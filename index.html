		<a href="http://www.phinnweb.org/links/literature/borges/aleph.html">The Aleph</a> is a short story by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jorge_Luis_Borges">Jorge Luis Borges</a> in which a man is suddenly able to see all things at once:

		<blockquote>
		On the back part of the step, toward the right, I saw a small iridescent sphere of almost unbearable brilliance. At first I thought it was revolving; then I realised that this movement was an illusion created by the dizzying world it bounded. The Aleph's diameter was probably little more than an inch, but all space was there, actual and undiminished. Each thing (a mirror's face, let us say) was infinite things, since I distinctly saw it from every angle of the universe. I saw the teeming sea; I saw daybreak and nightfall; I saw the multitudes of America; I saw a silvery cobweb in the center of a black pyramid; I saw a splintered labyrinth (it was London); I saw, close up, unending eyes watching themselves in me as in a mirror; I saw all the mirrors on earth and none of them reflected me; I saw in a backyard of Soler Street the same tiles that thirty years before I'd seen in the entrance of a house in Fray Bentos; I saw bunches of grapes, snow, tobacco, lodes of metal, steam...
		</blockquote>

		I wanted to present a version of what The Aleph might look like now, designed as an endless stream of descriptive passages pulled from the web.  For source texts, I took the complete <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/">Project Gutenberg</a> as well as current <a href="http://twitter.com">tweets</a>. I searched for the phrase "I saw."

		<p>
		The title of the piece is a reference to the narrator's summing up of the vast whirring world he's seen, one of "infinite wonder and infinite pity".
		</p>

		<p>
			A few notes: the piece defaults to only displaying text from Project Gutenberg.  Clicking on the buttons in the upper right of the screen changes the output. The Twitter feed may include offensive language as the the only filtering done is to ensure that the phrase "I saw" is contained within.
