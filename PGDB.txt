I saw directly that this melodramatic music, beautiful as it is, did not suit the occasion, for though the gaily attuned audience was visibly affected by the phrase, <i>Et moi j'ai l'me triste</i>, they did not show more signs of emotion than by making a little dab at their eyes with their pocket-handkerchiefs
I saw directly what was the trouble--far more important to him than a mere election
I saw distinctly how the round spots of sunlight glided over her face and her hair and the shadows of the foliage fell upon her breast and shoulders draped in white
I saw distinctly that, wherever they crossed each other, the veins containing mica and black schorl traversed and drove out of their direction those which contained only white quartz and feldspar
I saw distinctly the small, shiny dark green leaves and the little reddish twigs - and I smelled the sweet fragrance of the orange blossoms
I saw doctor in Washington
I saw doubt in my uncle's eye and put in quickly
I saw drink being driven underground by Prohibition
I saw drought devastation in nine states
I saw during my first talk with him that a free hand was exactly what he intended to give me
I saw dust rising from the desert over yonder, a short time ago
I saw each in her own family
I saw each of the reporters take Jarrett aside, and when I asked him what the secret was of all these asides, he answered phlegmatically, I have made an appointment with them for one o'clock
I saw each of them swell up the misty line of the horizon, far, far away beyond the derelict brig, and the next moment, with a slight friendly toss of our boat, it had passed under us and was gone
I saw earth's exaltation slowly creep Out of their myriad sky-embracing veins
I saw elephants at work, and at one period I lived in a timber camp, consisting of working elephants and mahouts
I saw enormous furnaces

I saw enough last night, on my way to Saint Bride's, to make me suspicious of every one
I saw enough not to fall in love at first sight
I saw enough of her from her answers to some idle sallies of gallantry, to know with what a lofty character she is endowed
I saw enough of him during that time in Paris to see that he was not only brave, but prudent and discreet
I saw enough of him to be very fond of him, he replied
I saw enough, however, to convince me that they possess most of the vices of nomade nations, without their good qualities
I saw enough, notwithstanding, to render me more uncertain than ever, as to the success of my own suit
I saw error where before I had seen only truth, and truth in many things where I had formerly seen only error
I saw even a shop for the repair of clocks and watches, and a barber's shop; the barber serving the aged and sick, and being otherwise foreman of the tailor's shop
I saw even the blue veins that traced their wanderings on the whiteness of her full throat
I saw even the books not as books but as visible points of colour
I saw even then that, domineering though I may be, I should probably never care to bring the child's condition to her notice again
I saw every body going away, answered George; so I thought it was time to look for you, and to go home
I saw every inch of ground under those trees
I saw every line of his face; for the light of the candle was full upon it
I saw every loom idle
I saw every noble impulse stifled in those occupied with theatrical matters, and a combination of the vainest and most frivolous interests maintained by a ridiculously rigid and bureaucratic system; I was now fully convinced that the necessity of handling the business of the theatre would be the most distasteful thing I could imagine
I saw every single idea in his head, every shift of, his mind, and how he half knew that he profited by my shunning to say flatly I desired to set out upon the discovery of the Bench
I saw everything in the glory of an everlasting sunset, for every word I read, I heard in the tones of your voice; through the radiant consciousness of your present beauty, received every thought that awoke
I saw everything out of doors with Ito--the patient industry, the exquisitely situated village, the evening avocations, the quiet dulness--and then contemplated it all from my balcony
I saw everything plain
I saw everything with new eyes, and could only marvel at my former blindness
I saw everything with peculiar sharpness and distinctness
I saw everywhere that the most distinguished men and women of the most highly cultivated minds, listened to me with interest; people entreated me to read, and I did so willingly
I saw evil such as I had never heard of; I went close to it, I even touched it, but I always kept my soul very far away, and I was like a person in a dream
I saw ex-secretary Nagel here the other day
I saw faces about me, but I did not see the faces which were actually out by our hall door
I saw faces around me grinning, glaring, receding, advancing, all turning at last into the same face of the Jew with the long beard and the terrible eyes
I saw faces persuasive to love, beautified by the light of Another and by their own smile, and actions ornate with every dignity
I saw fair regiments of children pour, Rank after rank, out of the schoolroom door By Progress mobilised
I saw fair women in their radiance rise And trample old traditions in the dust
I saw families on every hand either living quite up to their means or beyond them; rarely within them
I saw far back in the distance an indomitable man, faint and discouraged, after the terrible sufferings of a winter at a bleak fort in the wilderness, drag his weary limbs to the spot where New Orleans now stands, and defiantly unfurling the flag of France, determined to establish the capital of Louisiana on the treacherous banks of the Mississippi
I saw farm-carts going down the road at X
I saw fathers and mothers and their children dressed beyond their incomes
I saw fear leap into Aunt Varina's eyes
I saw fertile fields, riant vegetation, strange trees--I heard the cry of cricket and pee-wit, and sibilant sound of many insects, all of which seemed to tell me, At last you are started
I saw festoons of evergreen in token of Christmas, near at hand
I saw few other lights, but was indistinctly aware of many people stirring in the darkness, and a hum and sputter of low talk that sounded stealthy
I saw few people on the way
I saw few whites in the streets at this hour
I saw figures about it passing to and fro
I saw fine specimens a hundred and twenty-five feet high on deep bottom land a few miles below Glenora
I saw fires on shore, and knew that the country was inhabited
I saw fires on the water front, fires in the commercial district and also portentous columns of smoke hovering over the southern part of the city
I saw first A Regatta, and was struck by the beautiful drawing and painting of the line of boats, their noses thrust right up into the fore water of the picture, a little squadron advancing
I saw fish- hooks would not be of much value because Efoua was not near a big water of any sort; so I held fish-hooks and traded handkerchiefs and knives
I saw five horses lifted out of the hold, and led ashore over a bridge dropped from the vessel's side
I saw five large snakes all in a heap, and a number more twisting through the grass
I saw five or six, answered Giant
I saw folk under it up to the brow, and the great Centaur said, These are tyrants who gave themselves to blood and pillage
I saw for a moment only a woman's head and shoulders, a horse's head, a commotion of foam, a native tugging at the lasso, and then a violent scramble on to a rock, and a plunging and floundering through deep water to shore
I saw for hunger bite the empty air Ubaldin dalla Pila, and Boniface, Who with his crook had pastured many people
I saw for once in my life the perfect image of stupefaction
I saw for the first time an absolutely pure Greek profile, such as I had been acquainted with hitherto only from statues
I saw for the first time that your parents' separation had the effect of saddening your heart at that epoch
I saw for the first time the nutmeg growing in perfection
I saw for the first time, too, a lygodium and the large climbing potato-fern (Polypodium spectrum), very like a yam in the distance, and the Vittaria elongata, whose long grassy fronds adorn almost every tree
I saw for the time only that one face I so hated, for the heap of brush in the work was still blazing
I saw forms passing athwart the open windows; a van laden with articles of furniture stood before the door; a servant in livery was beside it giving directions to the men who were unloading
I saw forth issuing descend beneath Two angels with two flame-illumin'd swords, Broken and mutilated at their points
I saw forward and backward and all around me
I saw four fellows hanged in the Dom Platz
I saw four such outbursts in the course of that evening
I saw four such outbursts in the course of the evening
I saw fresh Sign of 2 horses and a fire burning on the side of the road
I saw friend Mortimer's feet were pointing toward the center of the lot, and not in the direction of either street
I saw from Yonder Silent Cave
I saw from his despatch that he feared the plotting of Romanillos, who, however, was not a person to cause much apprehension
I saw from his general appearance that it was a perfectly safe offer
I saw from his knowledge and capacities that he would never be able to attain a position of great influence, but his kindness of heart and his extraordinarily receptive mind filled me with a feeling of profound respect for him
I saw from his look that he was captured
I saw from my windows about 9 A
I saw from out the primal mud The reptiles crawl, of dull, cold blood, While winged lizards, with broad stare, Peered through the raw and misty air
I saw from the Beach
I saw from the beach, when the morning was shining, A bark o'er the waters move gloriously on; I came when the sun o'er that beach was declining, The bark was still there, but the waters were gone
I saw from the degenerate leer on his face this morning that he will not be able to keep silent about that little affair of ours back there
I saw from the door all his track in the dew And, I guess, called Come in and sit down
I saw from the first that Pompey only thought of flight: if I now follow him, whither are we to go? Caesar will seize my brother's property and mine, ours perhaps sooner than others', as an assault on us would be popular
I saw from the first that you were a red progressional, and nothing but the fear of old Killian kept you back
I saw from the front only the two first acts of my play

I saw from your face this morning that you are already undoing the effects of your vacation
I saw girls of thirteen prostitutes, girls of fifteen with child
I saw gleaners, yesterday, in the stubble-fields
I saw gneiss only in subordinate layers;* (* The magnetic sands of the rivers that furrow the granitic chain of the Encaramada seem to denote the proximity of amphibolic or chloritic slate (hornblende or chloritschiefer), either in layers in the granite, or superposed on that rock
I saw good butts of sugar broke open in the street, and people give and take handsfull out, and put into beer, and drink it
I saw great Science reverently stand And listen for a sound from Border-land, No longer arrogant with unbelief - Holding itself aloof - But drawing near, and searching high and low For that complete and all-convincing proof Which shall permit its voice to comfort grief, Saying, 'We know
I saw great big turkeys, geese, guineas, ducks and many others
I saw great businesses become but the ghost of a name because someone thought they could be managed just as they were always managed, and though the management may have been most excellent in its day, its excellence consisted in its alertness to its day, and not in slavish following of its yesterdays
I saw great fat men with their hair streaked with grey, balancing themselves on their narrow surf-boards, and riding the surges shorewards with as much enjoyment as if they were in their first youth
I saw great fields of wheat that had been cleared of stones, by generations of labor I should say
I saw great numbers of horses
I saw great numbers of illuminating contrivances, some of which pleased me by their arrangement of reflectors
I saw great quantities of gees feeding in the bottoms, of which I shot one
I saw great things to do
I saw green banks of daffodil, Slim poplars in the breeze, Great tan-brown hares in gusty March A-courting on the leas
I saw groups of fierce, squalid men, at every corner of the street, glaring out with wolfish eyes at my sleek skin and handsome clothes
I saw guilt in the face of Herr Schwartzmuller
I saw gun-barrels bent nearly double
I saw hardly any
I saw he began to take great interest in what I said
I saw he did
I saw he did not consider what he said as a compliment, but I was vain enough to want to know what he did think of me, so I asked: And in what way am I like General Laguerre? The idea of our similarity seemed to amuse Aiken, for he continued to grin
I saw he had a heavy beard
I saw he had a pretty large amount of money, and doubted his ability to keep as good a watch over it as he ought to
I saw he had fallen, like the rest of us, to think mainly of the house
I saw he had immediately connected my enquiry with the talk we had had in the railway- carriage, and his promptitude showed that the ashes of his eagerness weren't yet cold
I saw he had something to say; I did not think it was his own something; and I was ready to offer a large bet it was really something of Major Chevenix's
I saw he hardly knew how to blend together in his ideas the dancing fairy and delicate dame
I saw he knew me
I saw he liked your interest in them
I saw he must have some reason for answering me so abruptly
I saw he recognised me and gave him a civil salute, which he returned with a brusque nod and a sharper, Good-morning, Littlejohn, as he passed
I saw he regretted his speech as soon as he had uttered it
I saw he understood that his sovereign would have everything to gain by a reconciliation with France, and he told me that all Sweden demanded peace
I saw he wanted us anyhow; so I said, 'Come on!' to Beany, and swum up the side of the submarine, and clambered onto the little deck, and Beany followed
I saw he was a good-for-nothing fellow then
I saw he was a kind friend or a good master (whichever it was) to his Secundra Dass - seeing to his comfort; mending the fire with his own hand, for the Indian complained of cold; inquiring as to the rice on which the stranger made his diet; talking with him pleasantly in the Hindustanee, while I stood by, my candle in my hand, and affected to be overcome with slumber
I saw he was deeply moved and, full of apprehension, I put my arm round him and asked if he had had bad news
I saw he was endowed with great powers of agreeability; but I thought him obtrusive ; and that alone is a drawback to all merit, that I know not how to pass over
I saw he was evidently relieved by the determined tone of my refusal--at what expense to my heart lie was set free, he saw not--never knew--never suspected
I saw he was fixing him
I saw he was fretting very much about you, and I guessed what was in his mind
I saw he was getting very nervous, so took it from him, and in order to put him at his ease, I remarked,-- I think, perhaps, I had better show you, Joe, just for once, how I like my breakfast served, for every one has little ways of their own, you know; and you will try to do it my way when you know how I like it, won't you? Thereupon I arranged the dishes, etc
I saw he was holding back all he could to keep from crying, and I didn't blame him either, as we was to sail the next day and the old lady was his Ma
I saw he was irritable, and would have gone out if I could, but he saw me and I had to advance
I saw he was looking at the dim photograph of memory, and turned from him to Iris
I saw he was mocking, and threatened him with a mahl-stick, but he only laughed and changed the subject
I saw he was much agitated ; the gaiety which seems natural to him was flown, and had left in its place the most evident and unquiet emotion
I saw he was much moved
I saw he was not pleased with my remark, but I was not going back on it
I saw he was not sick enough yet, to be indifferent about his life
I saw he was not thick enough to break my arm, in case he got twisted round it
I saw he was now stung to the quick
I saw he was on his car about something, and I thought I'd better not monkey with him much
I saw he was proud of the son he was abusing, and that his very pride made him more sensitive to that son's neglect
I saw he was taken with you from the very first
I saw he was taking no steps toward making out my passport
I saw he was touching upon them mentally
I saw he was troubled with that lack of confidence in himself, so common to men of his kind; he was also too timid for one thrown upon a strange land with only genius to aid him in struggling against adversity
I saw he was trying to conciliate me, so I changed the subject to racing
I saw he was trying to trap me into disloyal admissions
I saw he was unhappy--unhappy at home
I saw he was unwilling to speak out, and that it was a mere effort to button up and evade the subject
I saw he was very pleased with this selection and asked tactfully, How did you manage to choose such excellent names, Uncle Francis? I chose one name from the Red Book, another from the Peerage, and another from the Clerical Directory, so that one gets--er--a more natural and lifelike combination in that way; and yet avoids a real name
I saw he'd forgotten it, but I didn't say a word; because he keeps turning the thing around so that a fellow don't dare call his life his own
I saw hedge-flowers which Aurelia might have plucked, shade where she might have rested, orchards where she might have tasted fruit, wells which might have cooled her feet
I saw her
I saw her a couple of years ago
I saw her a week later, and she said she informed those men with whom she had committed those darkest of sins of her firm resolution to live a virtuous life, and she locked her door; but they persisted in troubling her through the night, threatening to tear her house down or burn it
I saw her about it the same morning we got Hilda's letter; and she offers 200L
I saw her accidentally at a fountain, and watched her unobserved, while she bathed the feet of her little sister
I saw her act in Cato at eight years old, (when she could not stand alone, but was forced to lean against the side-scene,) better than any of her brothers and sisters
I saw her advertisement in the 'Morning Post
I saw her again after this, and Zamrah had married her
I saw her again at Dinant yesterday, and she told me of this young person
I saw her again the day after she told you-- You did! I murmured
I saw her again this morning from a window at Prestongrange's
I saw her alight from the train
I saw her always either flying, fetching, or carrying; neither rain nor sun stopped her
I saw her among the cushions of the royal wagon
I saw her amusing a set of little children in the prettiest, most animated way; and afterwards, when the young people were playing at some game, her gestures were so sprightly and graceful, that no one could look at the English girls beside her
I saw her and Dr
I saw her and I heard her, and she say the queer things for a child
I saw her around last year, looking seedy, as if she drank
I saw her arrange everything in my drawers, the neat appearance of which struck me; an attentive hand had evidently been there, and day by day put straight the unavoidable disorder consequent on sickness
I saw her as I came past
I saw her as I ran with a river through Pluto's kingdom
I saw her as I see you
I saw her at Cocheco, said the sick man
I saw her at Court on Thursday se'nnight looking beautifully cross at not having a man near her
I saw her at Waterford when I was a boy, and thought her a fair lass enough, that is all
I saw her at a country ball; There when the sound of flute and fiddle Gave signal sweet in that old hall, Of hands across and down the middle, Hers was the subtlest spell by far Of all that sets young hearts romancing: She was our queen, our rose, our star; And when she danced--oh, heaven, her dancing! Dark was her hair, her hand was white; Her voice was exquisitely tender, Her eyes were full of liquid light; I never saw a waist so slender; Her every look, her every smile, Shot right and left a score of arrows; I thought't was Venus from her isle, I wondered where she'd left her sparrows
I saw her at a distance to-day
I saw her at church once, when she was visiting her grandmother and aunts
I saw her at midnight
I saw her at the great fair of Tailteen
I saw her at the hall door a moment ago
I saw her at the salon, with her neck grown as long as her namesake's, but not as pretty, claws to match, thin and painted, as if the ruling passion was consuming her
I saw her at the sea-line's smoky rim Grow swiftly vaguer as they towed her on
I saw her at the window as we came along
I saw her before I ever knew--your daughter
I saw her before me transformed, saw color in her still, marble cheeks, saw her lips drift into a softer curve, heard the tremor of passion in her quiet, languid tone
I saw her bending over me with a maiden's love and a mother's solicitude
I saw her bending over something in this corner, and could not think what it was
I saw her bite her lip
I saw her blank stare
I saw her blush when that old lover passed by, or paused to speak to her, but it was only the sign of delicate feminine consciousness
I saw her blush, and grew cold with terror
I saw her blush, and she said: Yes, I should like to very much
I saw her bow her head
I saw her buried
I saw her buried from my sight, and then, Maddy, I started home; thoughts of you and thoughts of Lucy blended equally together until Aikenside was reached
I saw her busied for a moment at a little stand; she poured out water, and measured drops from a phial: glass in hand, she approached me
I saw her but a few moments since
I saw her but a moment, but the clasp of her hand was electric, and her voice penetrated my heart
I saw her but a moment, yet methinks I see her now, As she dropped the judge a curtsey, and he made her a bow
I saw her but a moment, yet methinks I see her now, With the bloom of borrowed flowers upon her cheek and brow
I saw her but a moment, yet methinks I see her now, With the card and heckle in her hand, a-teasing of that tow
I saw her but a moment--perhaps only an instant--but she took me captive then and there, forevermore
I saw her but now, as I came masked through the park, in conference with Mirabell
I saw her but once
I saw her but yesterday, full of sensibility and lovely as Sigismonda in Hogarth's picture
I saw her capable mouth set in a straight line of determination
I saw her cast herself back in the old oak chair, and cover her face with her hands
I saw her close her beautiful eyes and heard her murmur something in her sleep as I bent over and kissed her adieu
I saw her close her beautiful eyes, and heard her murmur something in her sleep as I bent over and kissed her adieu
I saw her come
I saw her come down again, three minutes later
I saw her coming away down the street, and the minute I got my peepers on her I picked her for a winner
I saw her coming from the building, and I wondered what she was doing there, that's all
I saw her coming here this morning, and I am determined to see her and hear my fate from her own lips
I saw her coming over the grass with outstretched hands, and such a smile on her dear face; and though I was so shy that I could scarcely greet her, I could feel by the way she kissed me how glad--how very glad--she was
I saw her coming up the avenue
I saw her compress her lips
I saw her concurrence with this proposal
I saw her courted by the gay young admirers whom her beauty and her fortune drew around her,--her soft face brightening in the exercise of the dance, which the gravity of my profession rather than my years forbade to join; and her laugh, so musically subdued, ravishing my ear and fretting my heart as if the laugh were a mockery on my sombre self and my presumptuous dreams
I saw her cousins, the Masons; that young fellow--you remember?--with a face swollen with tears
I saw her daily without hinderance; she helped to prepare the meals I enjoyed; she brought, in the evening at least, the wine I drank; and indeed our select club of noon-day boarders was a warranty that the little house, which was visited by few guests except during the fair, well merited its good reputation
I saw her daily, and no one could help becoming fond of her, she was so good, and gentle, and quiet
I saw her daughter at your house
I saw her day after day as I passed, sitting sewing in the wide west window above the holly hedge; and so long as she was left alone she seemed to be content; but I began to notice at this time that any interruption at her favourite occupation did not please her
I saw her declaration
I saw her declining in strength through failure of appetite, but ever hoped for finer weather and change of air to restore her
I saw her die: her brother too is dead; Nor own'd such crime--what is it that I dread? The parish aid withdrawn, I look'd around, And in my school a bless'd subsistence found - My winter-calm of life: to be of use Would pleasant thoughts and heavenly hopes produce; I loved them all; it soothed me to presage The various trials of their riper age, Then dwell on mine, and bless the Power who gave Pains to correct us, and remorse to save
I saw her down the pike that day, said Jason, not showing the surprise he felt
I saw her down there on the dock
I saw her drop the tear, I knew full well She felt for <i>you</i> much more than she could tell
I saw her either dying or dead, or in heaven with the angels; but in the morning all my fears had disappeared and a few days later I even forgot the whole thing
I saw her enough to distinguish splendid blonde hair, magnificent eyes, and such a complexion! Ah! ah! You understand! one does not easily renounce such a woman
I saw her even now: She hath not left us
I saw her everyday, and learnt, my friends, that love is stronger than a man's will
I saw her exasperated for the first time, and it sat very comically upon her
I saw her extended on a bier; the death-pall spread over her; the funeral service performed that proclaimed her dead to the world; her sighs were drowned in the deep tones of the organ, and the plaintive requiem of the nuns; the father looked on, unmoved, without a tear; the lover--no my imagination refused to portray the anguish of the lover--there the picture remained a blank
I saw her eyes Young with contentment in her son And smaller babe and in their handsome sire, And knew that many a supper had been relished With hearts as joyous as waited while she cooked And served upon returning to their cot In hall where once far other hearts caroused
I saw her eyes brighten as she caught sight of your face
I saw her eyes fixed upon me for a moment with a look of attention not previously granted to me
I saw her eyes flash with indignation, and this time it was I who dropped mine, while I felt my face flushing under her gaze
I saw her eyes narrow a little and then I marveled at time cleverness of the woman
I saw her eyes note the perfect fit of my uniform, though neither of us mentioned it
I saw her eyes open wide in astonished recognition, and then a deep flush swept over throat and cheek
I saw her eyes watering, and she is not clever in turning it off
I saw her face
I saw her face plainly when I passed her
I saw her face when she handed me the letter you have just read, and I assure you, sir, she is not in a malleable mood
I saw her fade rapidly away; beautiful, and more beautiful, and more angelical to the last
I saw her father too hanging about Gervaise's yesterday
I saw her features fall
I saw her first
I saw her first at a garden party
I saw her first five years ago at Gerard's; she came from Switzerland, where she had taken refuge
I saw her first in her dressing-room at the theatre, where she had kindly invited me to visit her for a quarter of an hour after the concert
I saw her first in her own home in the company of her mother, a pleasant Scotch lady, and her brothers, sturdy, clever, staid and silent lads
I saw her first several years ago
I saw her first when she was first a widow
I saw her flirting with you at the party last Christmas! Miss Maggie's face showed a sudden pink blush
I saw her float through the hall in his arms, drunken, lying with half-closed lids against his breast
I saw her for a few minutes this morning
I saw her for a moment this morning
I saw her for a moment, and she was even more vacant than yesterday
I saw her for one moment in Konigsplatz
I saw her for only a few minutes, and then within sight of other of Catherine's ladies
I saw her for the last time the day before yesterday at Lady Kildare's: never was a journey less a party of pleasure
I saw her fore feet pawing the air, and then only her head was above water
I saw her frequently again when war had been declared, for she it was who, every evening, with overpowering force and art, sang the <i>Marseillaise</i> from before the footlights
I saw her frequently, but not a smile, a look, a sign, on the part of the Empress showed me that I was in her eyes anything more than a stranger
I saw her from the pier goin' out, and I called to her, the guard replied, but she kept on all the faster
I saw her future a series of years of intolerable dullness
I saw her gallop out of the patch of rocks at the end of the Dormoir--where the trees begin
I saw her gazing earnestly at her brother's portrait and all the precious little objects consecrated to his memory, which I had arranged by my benitier and crucifix, but I did not expect her firs exclamation, when our woman had left us: 'Ah! Madame, how happy you are!' 'I was once!' I sighed
I saw her gently take the hand from her forehead and press it to her mouth, the tears falling down her cheek meanwhile
I saw her get in, and I have been watching ever since, and she has not got out, so she is there now
I saw her get into a carriage, which she had doubtless quitted to take a walk; and when she drove past, she put her head out and looked at me with her eyes wide open--there was an almost wildly anxious expression in them
I saw her give a little start, and distinctly heard the gasp which escaped her
I saw her glance sidewise at Agnes, the other maid, who stood with her back to us putting Nyoda's shoes onto trees; then she looked boldly at Nyoda and deliberately winked one eye! Nyoda looked at her with a puzzled frown
I saw her go
I saw her go away with Priscilla
I saw her go by a little while ago, and she 's much bigger than the Black Bantam
I saw her go into a hotel with a man and register as his wife
I saw her go into the house scarce a minute ago
I saw her go out
I saw her go up the stairs
I saw her go, lightly as a hare in the grass, towards the boy, and wondered
I saw her going to early mass, I said, and she looked as fresh and sweet as that lily--before you destroyed it
I saw her grand profile quiver, then the slow ebbing from her cheek of every drop of blood indignation had summoned there
I saw her grave, Rosalie, darling; I heard about her dying in the fair; and my husband found out where she was buried, and we went and stood by her grave
I saw her grow to be the pride of all this place
I saw her half-an-hour ago
I saw her hand in careless measures move; I heard sweet preludes dancing on her lyre, While my whole frame the sacred sound obey'd
I saw her hand; she has a leathern hand, A freestone-colour'd hand; I verily did think That her old gloves were on, but 'twas her hands; She has a huswife's hand- but that's no matter
I saw her here
I saw her here--when we came for The Wheezy--Mademoiselle D'Ormy and I
I saw her hold herself aloof and dubious, proud and coldly chaste
I saw her home from singing school--she warbled like a bird
I saw her hook a loop with Gill the Grip, With Pinky Smith and Handsome Hank she heeled; With all the dossy bunks she took a skip Each time the German tune-professor spieled
I saw her husband, my son, sitting in the hallway as I came through
I saw her imperfections; I felt the evil in her nature
I saw her in 1857 at Marysville, and disbelieve the story
I saw her in 1884 in Paris, where she was living with her mother, and I asked her whether the story had had anything to do with her action
I saw her in London several times during her stay; she returned to Switzerland, and I never saw her again
I saw her in Munich the first time
I saw her in Naples sixteen years ago
I saw her in New Orleans years ago when she was a very young woman--notorious then
I saw her in November, you remember, when I went to see Margaret
I saw her in a car on Fifth Avenue, not so long ago, with two heavy little black-haired girls; she looked sixty
I saw her in conference with the Boche general and his staff at the camp near Taveta
I saw her in her bed, surrounded by her women and attendants, who were all in tears
I saw her in her bed, surrounded by her women and eunuchs, all in tears, who seem to expect her death
I saw her in her box dressed in blue moire, with a huge ermine cloak about her bare shoulders; he sat opposite
I saw her in her house, the den of confusion: servants called to her for orders or help which she did not give; beggars stood at her door waiting and starving unnoticed; a swarm of children, sick and quarrelsome, crawled round her feet, and yelled in her ears appeals for notice, sympathy, cure, redress
I saw her in profile
I saw her in the arena--she is pretty, uncommonly charming indeed--and Marcus
I saw her in the back yard as I came in
I saw her in the chapel at the office
I saw her in the crowd, yet none were there That seemed so pure as she; and every eye That met her eye's mild glance shrank back abashed, It spake such innocence
I saw her in the glass there--she pointed to a mirror over the sideboard opposite--and then the shadow passed the window
I saw her in the kitchen where they were served with broth: a horrible spectacle, which haunted me the whole day and night afterwards
I saw her in the prisoners' dock, the Katusha betrayed by me, in a prisoner's cloak, condemned to penal servitude through a strange mistake, and my own fault
I saw her in the street the other day, and I wouldn't have been seen dead with the hat she had on; not a flower, nor even a scrap of a feather; just a plain band and a goose-quill stuck in it
I saw her in the village yesterday
I saw her in this part, and she gave the last act especially with such a composure and tragic feeling, that she might have been one of the best of German actresses; but it was precisely in this very act that the French liked her least
I saw her in white bodice and green petticoat, her arms and neck bare, her feet in old slippers, her black hair loosely coiled and stuck with a silver pin
I saw her ineffectual struggles to conceal the oppression at her heart
I saw her join her a few yards away, and did wisely to hold back
I saw her join him and take his arm on the boat, but wasn't sure who she was then
I saw her jump about with happiness
I saw her just a moment ago
I saw her just above the horizon, decorating and cheering the elevated sphere she just began to move in,--glittering like the morning-star, full of life, and splendour, and joy
I saw her just as plainly as I could see you when you sat up in bed, Sylvia declared
I saw her just before I left to come here
I saw her just now with Mr Jermyn and Charles
I saw her just there a moment since
I saw her laid low in her kindred's vault And presently took post to tell it you
I saw her laid low in her kindred's vault, And presently took post to tell it you: O, pardon me for bringing these ill news, Since you did leave it for my office, sir
I saw her last night and she wanted me to come with her
I saw her last night at Lady Whiston's
I saw her last night at a reception and recognized her
I saw her last night at the hospital, Al'mah answered
I saw her last night, and I could have made it all right had I chosen--she was quite willing
I saw her last night
I saw her last sailing down the river after the John Cropper
I saw her last term, and the term before
I saw her late last night before retiring to my cell, and she seemed even stronger than she had been for the last week
I saw her lauching
I saw her lips frame the whisper Yes in reply, and over her face there swept suddenly a look of great tenderness
I saw her lips parting as I neared the end of telling her that story, and the instant I finished she cried, Of course you thought it was father! I did my best to shuffle out, but she was a hopeless person to try to deceive
I saw her lips shut yet closer than before
I saw her lips trembling and the tears swimming up in her eyes
I saw her long wrinkled face, her toothless mouth, and that pointed chin of hers-- like the chin of some puissant old fairy
I saw her look
I saw her look at the fire-irons
I saw her look down upon the river, almost as we are looking now, and her eyes would grow soft and wet with tears, and she would tell me in whispers of the evenings she had spent with him, when the love had first come, and how sweet and tender he was
I saw her look up to him with the light of a great and passionate love in her eyes
I saw her look up, but that was all
I saw her lose her enchanting gayety, and become grave and sad, yet could do nothing to restore her spirits
I saw her love in every glance, in every smile
I saw her lying dead, and her face was beautiful and serene
I saw her lying on baby's grave
I saw her make a valiant effort to comprehend the sign painted on the side of the van--and give it up
I saw her make the effort to converse affably
I saw her marriage in <i>The Times</i> yesterday
I saw her more than once or twice withdraw her fork when almost at her lips, and, almost before she had laid it down, rise from her seat to obey some half-whispered, half-nodded behest
I saw her mosaics---very fair, very clever, some of them; but I'm afraid she is a sad little flirt, Miss Mohun
I saw her mysel' rinnin' aboot the toon, frae ane till anither, wi' her lang hair doon the lang back o' her, an' fleein' i' the win', like a body dementit
I saw her myself lying just outside the point
I saw her myself, the blood flowing where they had stabbed her, cold and dead
I saw her name in the landlord's book of Inverorum
I saw her never again 
I saw her next in a pinewood between Ischl and the Traun
I saw her no more until bedtime, when she stood at her aunt's elbow to hand and hold things, while Miss Harper, to my all but screaming embarrassment, bared the whole upper half of one side of me and washed and dressed my wound anew
I saw her no more
I saw her no more; she died in the following year
I saw her now and then, always stouter, better dressed, more successful and more automatic: she had become a lecturing-machine
I saw her on Sunday evening
I saw her on her throne in the chapel of Versailles and, though then pleasing in face and person, I thought her un peu passe
I saw her on the pier at Boulogne the day I came to England
I saw her on the rocks just now
I saw her on the swing then
I saw her on the wall of her chapel at Winchester saving a robber knight from the sea, yea and a thief from the gallows; but that is not being free
I saw her once Hop forty paces through the public street; And, having lost her breath, she spoke, and panted, That she did make defect perfection, And, breathless, pow'r breathe forth
I saw her once at Copsley; good-looking
I saw her once at your mother's
I saw her once twenty years ago at the New Brotherhood, and have never forgotten the vision of her face
I saw her once, at first, and she was like that, yes, exactly like that, with her hands up, so
I saw her once, nearly eighteen years ago, about the time you were born--but I was not capable of appreciating her then; indeed, was so unhappy and irritable as to be hardly in a condition to either make or receive favorable impressions
I saw her once--afterwards
I saw her once--not many months ago
I saw her once; but could not learn her name
I saw her once; silk dress, pretty boots, all feathers and scent, pink face
I saw her one day passing through the Square in Warsaw near the river corner
I saw her only to love her; nor was it a common passion she inspired in me
I saw her only yesterday, and she asked me of you with such splendid disregard for what the others standing by might think, and as though she dared me or them to say or even imagine anything against you
I saw her outside your office once at midnight, saying good night to you and to the children
I saw her pass beside my lofty station-- A glance--'twas all! And yet I loathe my daily honest ration, The air's turned gall! My soul's in chase, my body chafes to wander-- My dagger's filed-- Oh! this chill wind may change, and o'er the mountain May drive me wild! HENRY L
I saw her pass the window, said Rebecca in bewilderment
I saw her passing down the meadows half an hour ago with a strange young man; and her brother stopped behind near the millpond
I saw her permit Heriot to kiss her hand, and then the squire appeared, and Heriot and she burst into laughter, and the squire, with a puzzled face, would have the game explained to him, but understood not a bit of it, only growled at me; upon which Janet became serious and chid him
I saw her photograph when I took little Hugh to his uncle's, and they talked a great deal about her
I saw her picture the day of the garden party, and I recognized her at once
I saw her place it in her bosom, sir, and with the right hand, cried the Countess, as if betraying a state secret
I saw her play the same piece fifty times
I saw her post the letter, waited till she was gone, then went into the shop, and asked to see the Master
I saw her pour out something, which I swallowed unquestioningly, and after a moment sank into a quiet sleep
I saw her preceptor
I saw her put her arms around my neck as she often did long ago
I saw her put it under the urn
I saw her raise her face, and look upon me for the first time for eighteen years
I saw her reach down into her churn and get a handful of the salty, bruised cabbage and eat it, so I tried some
I saw her reading poetry and saying those words over to herself
I saw her ride away alone an hour before you reached that fork in the road and turned up this watercourse
I saw her rising Bosom bare! <i>Fop</i>
I saw her running away, but after going six or seven yards she stopped, and, turning partly round so as to watch me, waited in fear and trembling
I saw her save this unfortunate child with rare courage
I saw her scarce ever but at meals, and then of course in the company of James More
I saw her see me
I saw her set out to do it
I saw her several times, so as to stimulate myself to a higher and purer exercise of whatever genius I may have
I saw her slip away, he muttered, and I watched her come down again
I saw her smile
I saw her smile at me, I felt her giving me strength to live
I saw her smile, And look at me with tender eyes; And as I looked into their light, My foolish, fearful heart grew wise 
I saw her smile, although her eyes Were only smudgy smears; And then she swished her swirling arms, And wagged her gorgeous ears, She sobbed a blue-and-green-checked sob, And wept some purple tears
I saw her snatch from the child's hand some wild flowers the poor thing had been gathering; and how often have I thought of the rude way in which she did it,--not as a mother who loves her child
I saw her soon after; her eyes were too bright, her cheek colored; she was restless, and ashamed of being so; the balance was lost; mischief had begun
I saw her sort of shy out of meetin' the next Sunday, too, so he shouldn't go home with her, and I begun to think mebbe she did have some conscience after all
I saw her stand above the fallen body, looking down at it with a horrified face
I saw her stand and look after us with a perfect heaven of love on her face - this poor one-eyed Madonna - until the train was out of sight; but the man, sordidly happy with his gains, did not put himself to the inconvenience of one glance to thank her for her ill-deserved kindness
I saw her standing in an open meadow flooded with sunlight; and heard her voice as if from afar
I saw her standing there as pale as a corpse with the big tears rolling down her face
I saw her start; then she laughed awkwardly to cover her confusion, and went down in search of Lassen
I saw her steal them
I saw her strutting about with him yesterday, looking as if she thought the two of them made a procession
I saw her sway like something stricken by the wind; and I know not whether in cowardice or misery, turned aside and looked upon the floor
I saw her sway, like something stricken by the wind
I saw her take coach just now with her maid, and think I heard her bid the coachman drive hither
I saw her take milor's hand and press it against her heart in silent gratitude
I saw her take one from under her skirt the other day
I saw her talking to a man at the gate

I saw her the other day, and what he can see in her I can't think
I saw her the other day, said Abe
I saw her the other day, said Quarles, and I quite endorse your opinion
I saw her the other night sketching a frivolous gesture-- THE DICE THROWER By SIDNEY SOUTHGATE (Thomas Moult) (From <i>Colour</i>) 1922 Hunger is the most poignant when it has forced physical suffering to the highest point without impairing the mental functions
I saw her the very night when she went to meet the English milor' at his commands
I saw her there, in the splendid room she always dimmed with her greater splendour, the exquisite Marquess at her feet, happy in possession of the pearl of great price
I saw her this afternoon and helped her plow home-- Chetwood Belding! Wait till Jess Morse hears about it
I saw her this evening, and found that she has become sadly altered
I saw her this morning
I saw her this morning distressed
I saw her this morning in passing, out of the corner of my eye, and I know that she is well and enjoying herself
I saw her this morning; although she seemed to me less pale than usual, and declares she does not suffer, her health makes me anxious
I saw her through a space in the boughs overhead
I saw her to her door, said good night, and went home
I saw her to the dove-house climb, With cautious feet and slow she stept, Resolved to balance loss of time By eating faster than she crept
I saw her to-day
I saw her to-day, passing slowly along the street
I saw her too
I saw her towards the close of her honeymoon
I saw her tremble slightly beneath my voice, and blush beneath my gaze
I saw her try its latch two or three times and then turn back discomfited because the loose frame had sagged a trifle and needed to be raised half an inch
I saw her tugged down the river by a steamboat, which comes to the same thing, replied he
I saw her turn as he spoke, and fix those glaring eyes on me again
I saw her turn pale
I saw her twice yesterday
I saw her upon nearer view, A Spirit, yet a woman too! Her household motions light and free, And steps of virgin-liberty; A countenance in which did meet Sweet records, promises as sweet; A Creature not too bright and good For human nature's daily food; For transient sorrows, simple wiles, Praise, blame, love, kisses, tears, and smiles
I saw her very often while I was last in Philadelphia
I saw her walk out with her mother

I saw her walking down to the ferry with Annie as I was coming over from the office a little while ago, said Doc Simpson
I saw her walking with him in your garden, coquetting with him about a flower, just as she used to do with me
I saw her warn you, as far as looks could do, not to quarrel with the man
I saw her watching your hands at the table
I saw her wedded to another
I saw her weep for two hours or more without ceasing; and appeared very feeble when attempting to walk, so that two of us supported her by the arms
I saw her when she first put foot on the stairs, and notwithstanding my strong antipathy, I could not repress a certain feeling of admiration from mixing with the dread the least sight of her always occasioned me
I saw her when she was pelting my flock
I saw her when she was seventeen, in a short frock of staring blue; she was very thin then, and was escorted by a brother, squeezed inside a schoolboy's suit; they were out for their first walk alone, both red-faced, flurried, shuffling along the sidewalks of Bourges
I saw her when she was three years old, and she certainly was a fright when she cried, and, my lords, she cried all the time
I saw her while yet most humble in rank
I saw her whisper to him, he bending a little to catch her word

I saw her with him the other night at the Foreign Office
I saw her with my own eyes at Cumae, hanging in a jar; and when the boys asked her, 'What would you, Sibyl?' she answered, 'I would die
I saw her with my own eyes run across the street to Grinstead's, where he was, for we had just left him there; with a letter in her hand, too, which was not there when she came back all fluttered and blushing
I saw her with my own eyes, black hair, dark skin, slight figure, voluble, smiling, large-knuckled hands and a flashy eye, oh! a long way from being uninteresting to John yet, or a merely good woman
I saw her with my two eyes
I saw her with you at the real-estate office yesterday
I saw her wringing her hands, and heard her entreating Allah to take her life
I saw her years ago, but she didn't remember me
I saw her yesterday
I saw her yesterday at the consecration
I saw her yesterday in Faustine, in which she showed talent
I saw her yesterday standing on the edge of a rock looking out on the view, and she was like some statue of Fortitude
I saw her yesterday, and I can put you next to the game
I saw her yesterday, and she acted as if she had something on her mind
I saw her yesterday--and the day before
I saw her yesterday; it shall be some time before I see her again
I saw her! She was all in white, as a lady-love should be--only there were little flushes of pink on her dress like the sunset on a cloud--and she had diamonds in her hair,--Here Ipsie sighed a profound sigh of comfortable ecstasy--and she looked very sweet and beautiful--and-- and--Here he suddenly paused
I saw her! Shut up, you fool--it was his wife! exclaimed the young captain to whom Ferrol had given his last message for Christine
I saw her! he said, in a voice that sounded as if it came from the grave, and she heard it in her heart
I saw her, Rosamond; saw this young girl with his name upon her lips when waking--saw her, too, with his name upon her lips when sleeping
I saw her, and could not forget her; I sought her society, and was gratified with it
I saw her, and in front of her a man, with his back half on me
I saw her, and loved her, and grew sick with loneliness
I saw her, during the interval, come in with her nose in the air, sniffing and crying: 'That smacks of love! Ah! How I love such music!
I saw her, ere she saw me; and she was looking in his face as she never looked in my face
I saw her, from the tree, lie dead upon her bed
I saw her, in a manner that quickened my curiosity, give a glance back at the place from which she had come
I saw her, once or twice, afterwards, at a distance, and she always looked like a sort of home to me
I saw her, soon after we came here, with another woman, at the south end of the lake, where she was visiting in the family of one of the settlers, and I inquired her out, as she appeared so much above the common run of girls
I saw her, the other day, bespatter the Governor himself with water at the cattle-trough in Spring Lane

I saw here an alligator for the first time, which reared its head and shoulders above the water just after I had taken a bath near the spot
I saw here had been some Indian Plantations formerly, there being several pleasant Fields of clear'd Ground, and excellent Soil, now well spread with fine bladed Grass, and Strawberry-Vines
I saw here individuals of at least sixteen different tribes, most of whom had been bought, when children, of the native chiefs
I saw here on the table those very sweet preserves which a quarter of a century ago were to be found on every farmer's table in New England, if he had a thrifty wife, and which, after breeding a kind of epidemic of dyspepsia, have now, I think, entirely disappeared from our Northern tables
I saw here some large pieces of beautiful saline marble, but nobody could tell me from whence they had come, or whether there were any rocks of this stone in the mountains of Shera
I saw here some of the largest trees I had yet seen; there was one especially, a cedar, whose colossal trunk towered up for more than a hundred feet, straight as an arrow; I never saw its crown, which was lost to view, from below, beyond the crowd of lesser trees which surrounded it
I saw here some of the latter sort, in a small sheep-skin, which the Bedouins use in bringing it to market: it had a strong, turpentine smell, and its taste was bitter
I saw here that I should only be a bird of passage: it is a pity, for this house does us honor; and up to the last moment, I will serve my lord with the respect and esteem which are his due
I saw here the opportunity for which a man might wait months, and I was not such a fool as to lose it through pride
I saw here two implements called duhong, knives shaped like broad spear points, relics of ancient times, with which the owners would not part
I saw here what is called a Danish fort
I saw here when she was brought into the city and even then I vowed to possess her
I saw here, as I had remarked in an Arapaho village the preceding year, near the lodges of the chiefs; tall tripods of white poles supporting their spears and shields, which showed it to be a regular custom
I saw here, for the first time, <i>oat ale</i>; and oat cakes not hard as in Scotland, but soft like a Yorkshire cake, were served at breakfast
I saw here, for the first time, the sky-blue Chatterer (Ampelis cotinga)
I saw here, in the midst of all that at first so powerfully struck me of dignity, importance, and high-breeding, a true French Polisson; for he called the dog round her, made it jump on her shoulder, and amused himself as, Page 25 in England, only a schoolboy or a professed fox-hunter would have dreamt of doing
I saw high domes, and bottomless pits; heard the voice of unseen waterfalls; paddled three quarters of a mile in the deep Echo River, whose waters are peopled with the blind fish; crossed the streams Lethe and Styx

I saw him Who sat therein
I saw him a day or two before he died, sitting wrapped up in his blanket, and muttering to himself

I saw him a prisoner in the Camp about five o'clock

I saw him after it
I saw him after that dreadful thing had happened at Broadso's

I saw him again for an instant in March, 1848
I saw him again for the first time among the officers of the National Guard, the day these gentlemen were received at the palace, as we shall see later, and I have never seen him since; but as we were all much attached to him on account of his kind consideration for us, he was often the subject of conversation, and, I may add, of our regrets

I saw him again to-night
I saw him again when he was driving a milk-wagon
I saw him again with the princess at Erfurt, where they told me he had become jealous of the Emperor Alexander, who paid assiduous court to his wife; at which the prince took alarm and abruptly left Erfurt, carrying with him the princess, of whom it must in justice be said that there had been on her part not the slightest imprudence to arouse this jealousy, which seems very pardonable, however, in the husband of so charming a woman
I saw him again yesterday, and was surprised to find the levee-room had lost so entirely the air of the lion's den
I saw him again, after meeting him at Marian's
I saw him again, that devil--in a hansom near Paddington

I saw him alight from his carriage, with an eagerness, a vivacity, that assured me of the affectionate joy with which he returned to his country and family
I saw him almost that same instant, sir, that Captain Ahab did, and I cried out
I saw him and Duchess safe on board
I saw him and I'm frightened! Nonsense, child, it's one of the keepers asleep, or some stroller who has no business here
I saw him and Miss Burton emerge from a private parlor last night, and he probably understands Miss Burton's malady better than the rest of us
I saw him and the other guests come lounging out of the house in the course of the evening
I saw him as I see you now
I saw him as <i>he felt himself to be</i>

I saw him as plainly as I see you, Jasper, and should have sprung to meet him, but something held me back
I saw him ask my late companion for charity, and follow the gentleman for a few steps, when the latter, threatening him with his stick, the boy dodged to escape a blow, and then, by way of showing how lightly his bosom's load sat upon him, began turning wheels down the middle of the street

I saw him at the club when I went to meet my cousin
I saw him at the gate night before last asleep on the step
I saw him at the river-side, Down by the ferry lit by torches, hastening the embarcation; My General waited till the soldiers and wounded were all pass'd over, And then, (it was just ere sunrise,) these eyes rested on him for the last time
I saw him at the same time a child and a grown-up man; it seemed to me that my own life was about to be renewed in his and I felt from time to time an irresistible need of giving him something of myself

I saw him at the store yesterday, though
I saw him at the window, my lord

I saw him at your house last night
I saw him back himself in a crouching attitude against the wall of rock behind him, lowering his haunches, and rearing his head in a strange manner
I saw him bare his throat, and seize the blue cold-gleaming steel, And grimly try the tempered edge he was so soon to feel!

I saw him bear plates to the old people's table containing a pale mess which I rightly concluded was the minced chicken and rice--peptonized, already referred to by the old gentleman

I saw him before you did, Sue

I saw him but an instant, and disguised, Yet this is not the traitor; on his brow Observe the calm of wisdom and of years
I saw him but for three seconds, which is as much as he allows to any one body or thing
I saw him but once more alive
I saw him buttonholing Green in the Library, then with Speedwell on the Terrace
I saw him buy the first bottle, he said
I saw him buying them
I saw him by daylight as well
I saw him carrying his valise into the station, and then he disappeared
I saw him cast a quick glance at the others
I saw him cast away some that he caught, and others he dropped into a wicker basket, one with a narrow neck such as women used for water
I saw him catch Lulie about the waist, and kiss her on the neck
I saw him catch another in the same manner
I saw him catch the eye of the Mixer and astonishingly intercepted from her a swift but most egregious wink
I saw him change the moment he found me here
I saw him clearly now
I saw him come
I saw him come bowling up the slope with his familiar gait, evidently unconscious of my presence, and wearing that sturdy and almost hostile demeanour with which a true Briton marches into a strange city through the army of officious importunates who never fail to welcome the true Briton's arrival
I saw him come in and go out
I saw him come in, she says, and then, a few minutes back, I see 'im go again, with a great bundle on 'is 'ead he couldn't 'ardly stagger under! Oh, I says, that's news to me, I didn't know 'e'd gone, nor see him neither--- which I didn't
I saw him come into the hotel while you were gone for the guide-books, and I determined to keep it from you as long as I could; I knew it would worry you
I saw him come into town with his wagon
I saw him come out much agitated first from the Council of the Ancients, and afterwards from the Assembly of the Five Hundred
I saw him come out of his office--stiff, starched sort of chap, with a thin face and gray side whiskers! That's the man, I admitted
I saw him come out of the place just before I lost my senses
I saw him come out, very feeble and uncertain
I saw him come through the flaming rivers of the underworld
I saw him come through the hall; and, if he was not cleaned out of cross and pile, I never saw a ruined man in my life
I saw him coming across, and knew him at once from his manner of walking
I saw him coming along the road, swinging his stick, and frowning and humming to himself,--dear thing! And when he came near the house, and heard the voices, he stopped and looked, and began to go softly and slowly; so then I knew that he, too, wanted to see what was going on
I saw him coming down the winding path, hat in hand, with bowed head
I saw him coming from there, but where he's shoved it to, who can tell? ANSYA
I saw him coming in the distance
I saw him coming up the street
I saw him cross the street again and again, scan the faces of the passersby, dash up the various turnings and come panting back, his tongue, his tail drooping; one could even fancy there were tears in his eyes
I saw him dancing and laughing with some of them
I saw him dartin' among the trees with his white eagle feathers stickin' up like a buck's flag, replied Jonathan
I saw him dawdling round with old Tudor, perhaps he means to take her: she's a capital nurse, got ill herself taking care of her father, you know
I saw him day before yesterday
I saw him dead
I saw him dead, and helped to bury him
I saw him dead; a leaden slumber lies, And mortal sleep, over those wakeful eyes
I saw him decide equitably in weighty matters of trespass, slander, and a little wife-stealing
I saw him declaiming it with excited eyes--as I used to declaim it! Poor fool! * * * * * --Well, I made another desperate attempt
I saw him depart with great satisfaction, and gave myself once more to conjectures respecting the strange recluse
I saw him descend
I saw him descend from a cab at the door, and almost immediately after I was shown again into his study, where the solemnity of his manner led me to augur the worst
I saw him describe the outline of a grave,--the other standing there, silently looking on
I saw him directly I went to pick up the pieces
I saw him disappear from my view with a mixture of wonder and terror which I will not describe
I saw him disappear in the whipstick scrub, between the garden and the lagoon; then I backed out into the drain
I saw him disappear up aloft like a fly
I saw him distinctly as he passed the second mast
I saw him distinctly--might have shot him with my pistol as he sheered by me, his yellow eyes aflame, balanced on broad wings
I saw him dive into the bushes like a cariboo
I saw him do it
I saw him do it on this and on another occasion
I saw him do it twice; but the devils about him were too eager to be balked of their prey
I saw him do that; and the jeweller set out a tray of ruby necklaces and began to talk about them, and then von Kufner remarked that since they were so expensive he must not sell many
I saw him do them with my own eyes, answered the father warmly
I saw him doing that, said Archie
I saw him down in the field
I saw him down in the lobby
I saw him down near the bridge
I saw him drag himself into his shack, like a sick dog, an hour before dusk
I saw him draw first and attack Brandt
I saw him draw, he said
I saw him drinking at a hole in the rock, as heartily as a boy ever pulled at a gimblet-hole in a molasses hogs-head
I saw him drive amongst his people every day, and I bowed with the rest, I who could have spat in his face, I who carried with me the secret of his miserable perfidy, who knew alone why his ministers regarded him as a spoilt and fretful child
I saw him drive away
I saw him drive out as I went up William Street
I saw him drive up outside
I saw him driving down there this morning from Lebanon
I saw him driving in a carriage a few days before he sold out, with a staving looking woman
I saw him driving the chariot, and to me he resembled the Sun God, and he observed me, and looked at me, and his glance pierced deep into my heart like a spear; and when, at the festival of the king's birthday, he spoke to me, it was just as if Hathor had thrown round me a web of sweet, sounding sunbeams
I saw him drop quickly on his knees beside the unconscious girl
I saw him dying,--die,--of a broken and trampled heart
I saw him empty the ten of hearts once: very pretty
I saw him enslaved just as I--knew we were faring alike--knew the very thoughts as well as feelings in his heart, and instead of being consumed with sorrow, chuckled at the <i>knowledge</i> that <i>I</i> was the favoured one! I suspect now that she showed him more favour than myself, and taught him to put on the look of the hopeless one
I saw him enter
I saw him enter one evening with an expression of gravity on his face; he spoke of my mistress and continued in his tone of sadness, saying all manner of evil of women
I saw him enter such a house of sale,' Videlicet, a brothel, or so forth
I saw him enter the Gate of Shushan and the Court of the Women
I saw him enter the city and I opine that he is come hither in quest of me
I saw him enter your house, and I went into the coffee-house opposite for the purpose of making my observations
I saw him every day
I saw him every day; and I pitied him for having to depart, because he repeated to me every instant that he would have wished to live eternally as he then did, in his own country and with us
I saw him every few days
I saw him exchange a long silent look with Elsie, and then he took his station at the bedside next to Elsie, and opposite to the brigadier, who never looked up
I saw him exhibiting patterns of fashions to Randall, the village tailor
I saw him express the Irish sense of gratitude in a striking way in the White House, in my presence, as the result of a conference, in which the participants were the President and Senators Stone and Reed, both of Missouri
I saw him fall forward, and then I jumped off the plank and hurled it back under the hedge before I ran for the house
I saw him fall, and his horse galloped into the town without a rider
I saw him fall, she said
I saw him fasten ONE END of it, Polly, and so did you, but was the OTHER end fastened to this boat?' Why, yes, I--oh, Rose, you DON'T think we're--DRIFTING? gasped Polly
I saw him fight once or twice
I saw him fight there a couple of years ago
I saw him fighting in front of the paraschites' cottage, and he was more like my dead master than ever
I saw him fighting single-handed, with a band of Saracens, who had checked their headlong flight to attack him,--and then the clouds of dust took him from my view
I saw him fire
I saw him first (I <i>think</i>, for my recollection is here imperfect) at one of Hazlitt's lectures, or at one of Coleridge's dissertations on Shakespeare, where the metaphysician sucked oranges and said a hundred wonderful things
I saw him first and bid him guid-day afore ever she set her een on him
I saw him first as I came along William street
I saw him first at Harvard during a competition for the Boylston prize at which we were fellow-judges
I saw him first at the Lower Ford, with a swineherd's brat on his saddle-bow
I saw him first in Germany, where he circulated in the best company; though no one seemed acquainted with his history, even there
I saw him first in his brother's house, whither I had been sent on a message from the king, and his likeness to Bartja was so wonderful, that I almost fancied I was looking at an apparition
I saw him first just as I turned out of the Douglass' place, and he followed me all the way
I saw him first nearly twenty-eight years ago, when he proposed to become the illustrator of my earliest book
I saw him first, an' he spak to me first
I saw him fix a longing eye on the landing-stage as we drew near it, so I managed, by an adroit movement, to jerk his cap into the water, and in the excitement of recovering that, and his indignation at my clumsiness, he forgot all about his beloved graves
I saw him fix and mount his ladder with his little black pot swinging from his arm, and his red smoking torch waving with astonishing velocity, as he ran up and down the ladder
I saw him fix his cavalry thighs and bound off as if he meant to take a gate
I saw him flush
I saw him for a few brief moments after he had volunteered
I saw him for a short time last night, and spoke to him in my father's style,' said Carlo
I saw him for one minute an hour ago
I saw him for only a second
I saw him for the first time to-day
I saw him for the first time waltz with the Marquise
I saw him for the last time three years ago, when he was preparing his valuable biography of his beloved brother Arthur
I saw him frequently and had many chats with him
I saw him frequently when I was in London in May and June last
I saw him from my window ride off as if he were going to meet the afternoon coach
I saw him from the mizzen-topsail yard, and knew him well
I saw him from the wing by the side of that girl with her face the colour of mahogany, and her half-alive look
I saw him fronting the first rush when it struck us
I saw him get into his chaise and drive from the inn door
I saw him get out of bed this morning
I saw him getting whiter and whiter like your face--and looking into his victim's eyes in that queer surprised way you looked at Dabnitz
I saw him glance at her dress, which was a purple calico
I saw him glance from his load to the stock of mother and daughter, fast selling off, and become aware that his stock as compared with theirs was rather heathery, and he began to trim off roughnesses with his knife
I saw him glance sideways at the water
I saw him glide down through many a street; Tears followed him like spring rain; And yet ever unheeding tears or prayers, He mattered his wild wild refrain, Come away with me, sweet baby so bright, I love the young flowers of the rosebud's hue, What? mother would keep thee always in sight, And see the sad tears in those eyes so blue
I saw him go
I saw him go by to-day in his travelling carriage
I saw him go down under a stream of liquid steel-- Lorelei's horrified exclamation went unnoticed; Lilas's voice was shrill
I saw him go for'ard a little while ago
I saw him go in, and Porter and I have taken turns on watch ever since
I saw him go in, he says to himself, so he's bound to come out
I saw him go into eternity without being able to point him to the Lamb of God which taketh away the sin of the world
I saw him go into the scullery near by and souse his head and neck in a bucket of cold water
I saw him go over the side about the time we knocked off--rigged out for chasing the girls
I saw him go past o' horseback with her yesterday, and I didn't more than half like the looks on him
I saw him go to Jo Portugais a little while ago
I saw him go to a music store and buy a special instrument
I saw him go, but I thought you would take me in--though you do not like me much! Not like you, my child! echoed the mother tenderly
I saw him go, on my side, with relief
I saw him going along on the other side of the street with two or three fellows that didn't look no how at all like rum-bruisers
I saw him going over to the School House, and I heard him tell Wayburn that he wouldn't be able to play till four
I saw him grin as he fired
I saw him grow loutish before my adroit impassivity; his fencing was not with such tools
I saw him hanged at Genoa in 1742
I saw him headed that way a few minutes ago
I saw him here first--but only once or twice
I saw him here to-night
I saw him hesitate, saw him reflect

I saw him in a box with his friend and two--two ladies
I saw him in a few moments hurrying along the path which led to my brother's
I saw him in a hansom last night, late, crossing Regent Circus with a young woman--<i>the</i> young woman, to the best of my belief
I saw him in a terrific struggle
I saw him in a vision, the night I read in the <i>Richmond Enquirer</i> that you had been called to West Point
I saw him in amaze at sight of a gentleman; and he was himself immediately retiring, concluding, I suppose, that nothing less than business very urgent could have induced me to break through rules so rigidly observed by himself and all others
I saw him in driving past your home the other day, and did not quite like his looks
I saw him in his chamber, a feeble old man, but noble to look upon in all the monumental pomp of age
I saw him in imagination, a lonely old gentleman, sitting at his gate day after day, hoping against hope, muttering to himself maybe that it hardly seemed worth while, from his point of view, keeping the show open
I saw him in my dreams on a litter, but now I have got accustomed to it somewhat
I saw him in one of his fits, and saw his flesh, as it was thought, by the devil gathered up on a heap, about the bigness of half an egg, to the unutterable torture and affliction of the old man
I saw him in our early infancy with no definite motive (beyond the general policy of intrigue), no fixed design, which might somewhat have lessened the callousness of the crime

I saw him in the Battaile range about, And watcht him how he singled Clifford forth
I saw him in the battle range about, And watch'd him how he singled Clifford forth

I saw him in the distance, replied Edith
I saw him in the holy of holies of love, lying on the ottoman, not as slave, but as master, and she at his feet
I saw him in the instant he touched the horizon, because there was a little clear space between that and the clouds
I saw him in the morning getting off the family bed, where it was sometimes warm, and chewing at a crust of bread before he set off to school in company with other children, some of whom were stouter than himself

I saw him in the village after I left you
I saw him in the wane of life, and I heard him only in private, and through a stupid, careless interpreter
I saw him in this town this morning
I saw him in time and whistled him down; and I told the old chap very plainly that he could come up with me when I was ready or not at all
I saw him into the train
I saw him jump down now and again, and disappear round the curve of the road as though to look for something
I saw him jump off the roof of the house
I saw him jumping over the heather, knocking off with his cane the young shoots on the oaks, or turning his head to look at me as I struggled after, torn by brambles and pricked by gorse
I saw him just a minute ago
I saw him just as plainly as if he had been there
I saw him just as the old lady spoke to you, but before I catches your eye, he cuts and runs
I saw him just before I left London, and he told me that he was going to stay in London for the first half of August, that he liked London in August, even though his club would be closed and Horton's delivered over to the painters
I saw him just now, she said after a moment
I saw him just when he was going away, but for a moment; till the last instant he was not to be seen; then, in spite of all his command of countenance, I discerned strong marks of agitation; but towards me an air of resentment, more than any disposition to kinder thoughts
I saw him kill himself, said the apprentice
I saw him kiss her in the door that night myself, and I knew it was true
I saw him kiss the Black Stone, and by virtue of the kiss he lived
I saw him kissing you, and he said he was fonder of you van Bell or ve Butcha or me

I saw him last night and he did not know me
I saw him last night at the Cafe Real--the poor man had the air of a funeral, and took his wine as if it were sour

I saw him last night, and the night before last, and the night before that
I saw him last night, but had no private talk with him
I saw him last week with an apron on, said Lyman, contempt in his voice
I saw him last, shortly before Christmas, at the Athenaeum Club, when he told me that he had been in bed three days--that, after these attacks, he was troubled with cold shiverings, which quite took the power of work out of him--and that he had it in his mind to try a new remedy which he laughingly described
I saw him lay the child upon a couch, and put his hands upon its forehead, and close his eyes, apparently in prayer

I saw him leave the house, added an old woman
I saw him leaving as I came in

I saw him less than one year ago, and we enjoyed a good laugh as we rehearsed the affair of the Planters' House
I saw him lie doubled in his blood and a grenadier below him--and he died for my papa! All died for him, or risked the dying, and I lay for him all those months in the rain and skulked in heather like a fox; and now he writes me his advice! calls me Carluccio--me, the man of the house, the only king in that king's race
I saw him lie on the sofa nearly a whole day, the table before him covered with maps and papers at which he did not even glance, and with no other occupation for hours than slowly tracing large letters on sheets of white paper
I saw him lift one hand, then started back from the square of darkness that yawned suddenly as to engulf us
I saw him listen to mass and go through the other holy ceremonies very devoutly, until it was over and the people had gone

I saw him look at John, who winked in return
I saw him look at Una so, yesterday, several times
I saw him look at it and I gently hinted that I had worn it in the hope that he would approve
I saw him look hard at his antagonist, and as he did so, his hands and his jaw dropped together
I saw him look towards me with surprise, then he started, his voice hesitated for a moment, but he almost immediately continued his benediction, and, as it seemed to me, with a voice tremulous with emotion
I saw him looking anxiously about him, and noted that Kelly, who had come forward at the last moment, was missing

I saw him many miles from here not long ago; and although he is quick on his legs--none quicker--He cannot be here yet
I saw him many times after that, and he was always a good friend to me; indeed, I was thinking of him when I called Boston the City of Kind Hearts

I saw him marking upon it with a sharp instrument, which he suddenly hid in his bosom
I saw him married to a widow, rather older, with a good cook and a well-run house
I saw him more and more after I went to live in Cambridge in 1866; and I now wish to record what I knew of him during the years that passed between this date and that of his death
I saw him more than once in straits harsh enough to try the patience of a saint, and noted with surprised admiration that his perfect poise was not in the least disturbed
I saw him most in the fastest society, amongst people who petted him for the sake of his genius and vivacity, but who would turn their backs upon him to-morrow if he were no longer able to amuse them; the set into which an artist is so apt to fall when his home influences are not strong enough to keep him steady, and when he has that lurking disposition to Bohemianism which has been the bane of your brother's life
I saw him mount high
I saw him move on towards the companion-way, and though I felt instinctively that all had gone ill with him, I was surprised to see how erect he walked
I saw him my own self, Grandpapa
I saw him myself
I saw him myself fight fifty rounds after his jaw had been cracked in three places

I saw him myself, I tell you
I saw him myself, three weeks ago
I saw him near the door while they hooted him
I saw him next alone;--nor camp Nor chief his steps attended; Nor banner blazed, nor courser's tramp With war-cries proudly blended

I saw him on the Main Street of town here, one Saturday evening when I had come to town with father, and two weeks after that I met him again at a dance out in the country, she said
I saw him on the North-west coast, on board the Beagle, apparently perfectly civilized; he waited at the gun-room mess, was temperate (never tasting spirits), attentive, cheerful, and remarkably clean in his person

I saw him once in the White Valley, Pierre said in a low voice
I saw him once in the street, but it's a question which of us tried the hardest to get out of the other's way
I saw him once more, but only once, when a day or two later he drove up by our hotel in Magnolia toward the cottage where his secretary was lodging
I saw him once only give himself up to a transport of this kind; and certainly the circumstances which caused it, and the reparation which followed, ought to render it, if not excusable, at least easily understood: This is the incident, of which I was a witness, and which took place in the suburbs of Vienna, the day after the death of Marshal Lannes

I saw him one night at a hell
I saw him one night at the Midnight Revels
I saw him only a few months ago when Aubrey and I passed through Paris
I saw him only about a week in a watering place, and subsequently he was able to maintain his position of hero-friend by a correspondence in which he answered my fervent ingenuousness stammered in poor German with fluent plagiarism from the classics of his romantic fatherland
I saw him only at rare intervals
I saw him only for a very few moments, so cannot put my observation against hers, especially as I was influenced by what I had heard the Liverpool people say of him
I saw him only in his bland and kind moods, with a flow, perhaps an overflow, of the milk of human kindness for all who were in any manner dependent upon him
I saw him only once; we did not meet; There was a street between us; yet it seemed Wide as the unbridged gulf that yawns between The rich man and the beggar

I saw him open his pocketbook last night and in it was a roll of bills
I saw him out only yesterday or the day before

I saw him over there
I saw him over to the house
I saw him pass the window a moment after with that foolish white hat on his head; he couldn't have been thinking what he was about when he put it on

I saw him pass through the hall, looking awfully stiff, important, and condescending
I saw him peeping through that bottom broken pane on your left hand as plainly as I see you

I saw him pitching and catching ball in a vacant lot with one of your clerks the other day
I saw him playing <i>cart</i> with a Frenchman just before we left Madame Caballero's; and, unless I am profoundly mistaken, the man is a gambler

I saw him poring over the note and reading it as if it were Gospel, and I suspected nothing
I saw him pour a liquid from a large bottle labeled, Satan's Malaria Cure
I saw him preparing to go; and, being exceedingly anxious to have a determinate answer, I added--'Let me intreat you, Sir Barnard, to give me an explicit declaration of what you expect from me
I saw him presenting it to the Protectour of late
I saw him presently a little way off in the garden, talking to the landlord of our inn, and looking towards us as he talked--they both looked towards us--and after that, without the ceremony of a farewell, he disappeared, and we saw him no more

I saw him reach down and pull from them a few strands of dark hair that had caught between the rods and had been pulled out or broken
I saw him reach with his left hand for his dagger, and I grew sick at the thought that I had no similar weapon with which to make matters even
I saw him read that, though he told us all the rest without book; how all the enemy began to quarrel, and all killed one another, and the Jews had nothing to do but to pick up the spoil, and sing another psalm coming back
I saw him reaping the reward of his illustrious deeds in the quiet shade of his beloved retirement
I saw him rejoin his guest, and I crept quietly back to where my companions were waiting to tell them what I had seen
I saw him review some volunteers at Montreal
I saw him ride in the circus the other day on a bareback horse, and even now his name stares at me from yonder board-fence, in green, and blue, and red, and yellow letters
I saw him ridin' in just as I left the eatin' house
I saw him riding down that way, replied Walter, pointing excitedly
I saw him riding down the street, by the Htel de Ville, myself, not ten minutes since
I saw him riding with that lank Biberli, Katterle's lover, who serves him, and such noblemen are not found by the dozen
I saw him rise early from table, he added, and I thought he was coming to YOU
I saw him rise from his kneeling posture, and walk away to hide his emotions
I saw him rotting
I saw him run after a gilded Butterfly, & when he caught it, he let it go againe, and after it againe, and ouer and ouer he comes, and vp againe: catcht it again: or whether his fall enrag'd him, or how 'twas, hee did so set his teeth, and teare it
I saw him run after a gilded butterfly; and when he caught it he let it go again; and after it again; and over and over he comes, and up again; catched it again; or whether his fall enraged him, or how 'twas, he did so set his teeth and tear it; O, I warrant, how he mammocked it! VOLUMNIA
I saw him run through the level open plain about three miles, till he disappeared in the woods on medecine river; during the whole of this distance he ran at full speed, sometimes appearing to look behind him as if he expected pursuit
I saw him run to the bell and tug violently at the rope
I saw him running behind the temple; he approached me, shaking his fist
I saw him running for all he was worth
I saw him sad and seedy, yet methinks I see him now, In the tableau of the last act, with the blood upon his brow
I saw him save a regiment and retake a position
I saw him say something to the girl he was dancing with
I saw him say something, having put away his pipe, and wiping his face with a striped silk handkerchief
I saw him scowling at me more than once this morning
I saw him scratch his head, and go to the chart which lay on the companionway
I saw him seized in mistake for me
I saw him several times
I saw him several times afterward; and I once had occasion to say to him, that I had already told him I would not employ him; and he always lifted his hat, and looked at me with a forgiving smile
I saw him several times during the fire and he didn't mention her
I saw him several times, in the street or at the play, but took no notice of him
I saw him shade his eyes with his hand as she approached; when she was within a few yards of him he took his cigar from his mouth and raised his hat
I saw him shift along for a couple of inches, and I was just about to order him back--the words were trembling on the tip of my tongue--when I was struck with great force by a heavy figure that had leaped through the air upon me from the lee side
I saw him shinning down a rope
I saw him shooked and so did Bert, didn't you? and Freddie looked at his older brother
I saw him shoot
I saw him shoot my mother
I saw him signal a sampan to come alongside, get into it, and go off in the direction of a cluster of local steamers anchored close inshore
I saw him sink, and my heart gave a leap as if it were going out of me
I saw him sitting there lonely in a corner like a sick crow, and I went over one evening to talk to him
I saw him slaughter the lame goat
I saw him slide an Episcopalian Prayer-book up his sleeve, and when I looked over the edge of the stretcher there was half-a-dozen enlisted men --privates--had just quit digging and was standing to attention by their spades
I saw him sneaking around the empties just before dark
I saw him so often in the course of the evening, which passed very pleasantly, contemplate Richard and Ada with an interest and a satisfaction that made his fine face remarkably agreeable as he sat at a little distance from the piano listening to the music
I saw him spar, not long since, at a private exhibition, and do himself great credit in a set-to with Henry Finnegass, Esq
I saw him speaking to you
I saw him speeding away--to come again! said my heart, solemn with gladness
I saw him stand Before an altar--with a gentle bride
I saw him stand behind Ombrelia's chair, And whisper with that soft, deluding air, And those feign'd sighs which cheat the listening fair
I saw him stand by the altar when they laughed at breakfast
I saw him stand uncovered in the bitter air, with a reverence for something
I saw him standing across the street in front of the house last night after you had gone
I saw him standing for hours together on the stone quay, with the handle of his walking stick in his mouth, staring down vacantly, with his black almond-shaped eyes into the muddy waters of the harbor
I saw him standing in front of Shepheard's Hotel this morning, waiting for you
I saw him standing looking at me, and at the close of the dance I heard from him one sigh
I saw him standing with open arms, and quickly I threw myself into those arms
I saw him staring upward with a peculiar expression upon his face, and following the direction of his glance I could see an awning spread over one of the gray-stone balconies
I saw him start, though you did not, Palliser continued
I saw him steady himself with his right hand on the coral lump, and thrust his left arm into the hole to the shoulder
I saw him steal it, through the window, while the woman's back was turned
I saw him steal it--and you? No
I saw him stiffen as he listened
I saw him stop and stand before the Gate Beautiful
I saw him strike the gong and asked of him straightway, viii
I saw him struggling out of his gown as he disappeared, and thence inferred that the chief burgess was a grocer in private life
I saw him suddenly dash himself down upon his knees despite his fetters, and beat his face into the dust, crying out the while in a passion of hoarse remorse that made one's heart shake:-- Pardon! pardon! pardon me, little one! That I did--not for hate was it done, but in mad fear only, in my desire to escape
I saw him sweep one hasty glance around, as though he suspected that I might not be alone, and his hand fell once more upon his sword hilt, in posture suggestive of readiness for action
I saw him take his oaths in the House of Lords,' said Lord Cumnor, apologetically
I saw him take his place as 'the poet': the poet who doesn't write
I saw him take his restorative at one draught
I saw him take some very fine white powder and dust it quickly over the bottle
I saw him take something and rub it on her lips, and the brightness went away
I saw him take the black box and set it on the tripod
I saw him take two clean glasses, and pour water from a pitcher into one, and it seemed to turn instantly to wine; then he poured that glass of wine into the other empty glass, and immediately it turned back to water, or seemed to
I saw him taken out for an airing by the groom
I saw him taking you over to the dam day before yesterday and telling you where to work on it
I saw him talking to my old friend Tommy Tit the Chickadee, and I just know that Tommy will tell me all about him, she thought, as she scampered along certain private little paths of her own
I saw him talking to you and looking as black as thunder
I saw him talking with two other men
I saw him telling me with a concerned look on his face that he had spent more time with me than with any other student
I saw him that night, make his way down the crowded aisle of the church, give the minister his hand, and say, I will
I saw him the day before I left; told him where I was going
I saw him the day before, on the day of Quatre Bras
I saw him the morning after his arrival at St
I saw him the next day with all the signs of a severe attack of yellow fever
I saw him the night after the battle--indeed, met him on the field as they were bringing him from the front
I saw him the other day in our bank
I saw him the other day on his knees, looking at a stump as if he expected to find gold in it
I saw him the other night, and from what he said, and what she says, I can see pretty well how things are going
I saw him then for the first time, and heard him laugh and cheer
I saw him then in the midst of his family, and perhaps never afterwards to better advantage, or in a finer mood
I saw him there during last night--I know him to be there--he will be there, either until you take him, or until his arrangements are made for getting out of this country, answered Yada
I saw him there first
I saw him there only this afternoon
I saw him there only yesterday
I saw him there, wrapped in a long loose cloak, the hood of which was drawn over his kpi
I saw him thestreen (yestereven)
I saw him this afternoon but had no notion of all this
I saw him this afternoon, continued Madam Bowker, talking aside to her alone when the ripples from the new stone in the pond had died away
I saw him this morning
I saw him this morning about 8 1/2 coming in to business, riding on Vermont avenue, near L street
I saw him this morning when I was out
I saw him this morning, and implored him to be merciful
I saw him this morning, remarked Collingwood
I saw him three days since, and he asked me if I had been impressed lately with the idea vulgarly called Clarence Linden; and he then proceeded to inform me that he had heard the atoms which composed your frame were about to be resolved into a new form
I saw him three months afterward in Washington, with his leg amputated, doing well
I saw him thrice afterwards
I saw him through college, and helped him through the difficult love affair that gave him his wife; and then he and my husband had a real German, enthusiastic love for each other, which ended in making me a wife
I saw him throw back his shoulders and grow erect again as he opened the door, and I heard him say in quiet, steady tones, I hope you will pardon the interruption, gentlemen
I saw him throw four men out of a hotel once for insulting a girl, so I knew that he was much better at that sort of thing than I
I saw him throw them into the tray last night, and I walked them out again, while he was talking to the crowd
I saw him throw up his clenched hands, and shake them wildly above his head
I saw him throw up his hands--heard him scream--but I never thought what the matter was, even then
I saw him to the door; an omnibus was at the moment passing the corner of the lane
I saw him to whom my father and mother married me, cut down before our city, and my three own dear brothers perished with him on the self-same day
I saw him to-day and his mother said to me, 'Take him with thee
I saw him to-day and his mother said to me, Take him with thee;' so this morning I brought him that he might be a servant to the king, for that he is an adroit youth and a clever
I saw him to-day, she answered
I saw him to-night, about eight--helped him to shut up his shop--and he had got the letters then in his hairy cap
I saw him today
I saw him today, in his carriage at Versailles, I said
I saw him too, Edward--I shall never forget it!
I saw him tramp across the courtyard and up to the house as I went off
I saw him treading water
I saw him try on his buff coat and hat-piece covered with black velvet
I saw him try to kiss ye, he said indignantly
I saw him turn and seize her hand, and then they disappeared behind the green wall
I saw him turn pale, and such was his haste to leave the house that he did not wait to see that the paper burned when he threw it in the grate
I saw him turn round and wipe his eyes with his handkerchief
I saw him twice as you passed, walking close at your heels
I saw him twice in retirement at Tzarskoye Selo, and came to respect him much
I saw him twice talking with the senior sacristan, observed a young woman
I saw him twice, and twice he told me the name of the man whose death he sought
I saw him twice, continued Brandon, without noticing the question, of the other
I saw him twice; once at the time of his accident-- that was only a nightmare, his face covered with-- I shivered
I saw him two days before
I saw him two days before his death
I saw him two hours ago
I saw him two or three times, she said, as she made her way to the warm but dark corner near the fire
I saw him two years afterwards apparently well
I saw him under most trying circumstances, and I can pledge myself for the truth of his devotion
I saw him unlock the door of the laboratory and I bent out of my window, and tried to call him
I saw him up to his stirrups in blood at St
I saw him upon the following day, the fourth of the disease
I saw him use it, not a week ago
I saw him very frequently at my dear old friend's,
I saw him very plain; a high, feverish exultation appeared to boil in his veins, and he stood and smiled and smirked upon the candle
I saw him visibly moved once to sadness, when some one told him how tourists had spoiled the country people in a part of Ireland
I saw him walk down the pier like one breaking up a levee
I saw him walk up along the fence, and throw it over
I saw him walk up to the glass, and walk back from the glass
I saw him walking in the shrubbery
I saw him walking that way a while ago
I saw him watchin' ilka mov' ye made, mem, a' the time ye was doon upo' the shore--an there he is noo, or was a meenute ago, at the heid o' the brae, glowerin' the een oot o' 's heid at ye, mem! Div ye ken him? asked Miss Horn
I saw him wave his hand to his mother just then
I saw him weeks afterward, and he told me that he had not had the toothache from the hour he took the medicine
I saw him weeping one day--it was where she used to sing to the flax-beaters by the Beau Cheval
I saw him welcomed by a great procession of Democrats, and marched under a broiling sun, through dusty streets, to the City Hall, where he was forced to listen and reply to fulsome speeches prophesying his election, which he and all present knew to be impos- sible
I saw him weltering in his blood, and I heard him say, 'Perfidious, <i>ungrateful</i> Virginia! you are the cause of my death!'--and I screamed, I believe, and that awakened me
I saw him wet the tip of his little finger upon his tongue, and take up one of my largest pieces, and then another; but he seemed to be wholly ignorant what they were
I saw him when he told the doctor he must go; and I tell you that no man living could have set his will against Robert Monroe's at that moment
I saw him when he was a small boy; I did not recognize him, said the abbot
I saw him when he was struck
I saw him when they brought him back
I saw him where he lay along, sucking a fruit in his left hand
I saw him while you were all talking
I saw him whisper something
I saw him whisper to Gregor, and the gipsy attaman started on hands and knees to creep round behind her
I saw him who was created more noble than any other creature, down from heaven with lightning flash descending, at one side
I saw him wince
I saw him wipe his cheek: then covering his face with his hands, his breast heaving with the most convulsive throbs, he flung out of the room
I saw him with Burlock and I could identify him
I saw him with Garcia and Bolla and Cardoni more than once
I saw him with Rosey next day, and began to smell a rat then, but Laxley won't give up the tailor
I saw him with a doughnut the other day, and took it away from him; knew he got it by accident, of course
I saw him with her
I saw him with it last night
I saw him with my own eyes, Daisy, get knocked into the ashes by a young man, and jump up and run at him with both fists out--and all on your account, too, my lady; and then-- Oh, I am reminded! It was Daisy who cried out, and with visible excitement
I saw him with my own eyes; and that was the reason why I left the theatre and sent for you
I saw him with the devil in the Black Canoe at the Saguenay
I saw him with the torch in his hand
I saw him with you once in the Bois de Boulogne, and once in a hell in the Palais Royal
I saw him within a few hours of his reaching England, and I was a witness to the joyful pride with which he looked forward to his re-union with his wife
I saw him working at the crank when I came here last
I saw him write it
I saw him write upon that pad, tear off and give the sheet to Ekstrom
I saw him writing on the bottom of the vase for some minutes
I saw him yesterday
I saw him yesterday afternoon for the first time in my life
I saw him yesterday and many times before
I saw him yesterday very close to-- a saloon! Poor Jake! said Dorothy with a sigh
I saw him yesterday, and I am sure the boy is mighty sorry for having been concerned in the matter, being, as I truly believe, terrified into it
I saw him yesterday, and it drove me wild
I saw him yesterday, and told him I must have the money at once: in fact, I pressed him pretty hard about it
I saw him yesterday, wearing the money- tray like an easy collar, instead of offering it to the public, taking the man against his will, on the invitation of a disreputable cur, apparently to visit a dog at Harrow--he was so intent on that direction
I saw him yesterday,' and as she gazed as if the news were water to a thirsty soul---'he sent his love, and begged his mother and you to forgive the distress his precipitancy has caused
I saw him yesterday; his flesh hath swallowed a good many of his bones since I looked on him last
I saw him yet a third time
I saw him! she declared
I saw him, I still see him, like a martyr
I saw him, I tell you, and it was not a dream, or my imagination
I saw him, a long way off, at the dinner given to Herschel (about 1838) on his return from the Cape and there we were not near enough, nor on that crowded day could we get near enough, to exchange a word
I saw him, all right, don't you forget it, declared the one addressed
I saw him, also, on a few other occasions
I saw him, and I could have thought him my dear old friend himself, as he joined Charles in his last desperate attempt to rally his forces, and then charged down Sidbury Street with a few bold spirits who were resolved to cover their master's retreat
I saw him, as I passed through Chester, going to prison, amidst the execrations of the populace
I saw him, astern, very plainly, while on the ship's quarter; but lost sight of him, as soon as the boat was in the water
I saw him, but it was too late to speak those words of comfort
I saw him, for my eyes were fixed on him, expecting to see him fall
I saw him, from time to time, and was much struck by his resemblance to the first emperor
I saw him, his eye was on me; there he stood, looking through that window, smiling and beckoning me
I saw him, however, very rarely
I saw him, in my mind's eye, to be the representative of the ancient Boyds of Kilmarnock
I saw him, my dear, he said, and he was in a temper that would have proved his descent had he been lost in infancy
I saw him, nevertheless
I saw him, of course, a friend; but I think I know him, and should like to be certain
I saw him, of course, after the election, before returning to Germany, and in fact sailed on the fourth of December at his special request
I saw him, one day, thus most deeply moved And darkened; ah! his face was like a tomb That hid the dust of dead and buried smiles, But, suddenly, his face flashed like a throne, And all the smiles arose as from the dead, And wore the glory of an Easter morn; And passed beneath the sceptre of a hope Which came from some far region of his heart, Came up into his eyes, and reigned a queen
I saw him, one moonlight evening when the peace and purity of our Arcadian west were at their height, polk with the lovely daughter of a cleaner of gloves, from the door-steps of his own residence, across Saville- row, round by Clifford-street and Old Burlington-street, back to Burlington-gardens
I saw him, single-handed, fight with Abradas and three other knaves who stole me from my mother's home--oh, very long ago! He killed all four of them
I saw him, there was another though, lying not far thence, the sight of whom moved me more
I saw him, therefore, quite without prejudice, for or against him ; and indeed, I must own, he soon gave me a strong interest in his favour
I saw him, therefore, with very different ideas to those raised by the sight of his poor sister Duncannon, to whom he made up with every mark of pitying affection; she, meanwhile, receiving him with the most expressive pleasure, though nearly silent
I saw him, though to him I was only a stone at my door
I saw him, too
I saw him, too, and I dodged behind him
I saw him, too, out walking in the afternoons with the young ladies of the town
I saw him, trying his best to get to Mister Ward
I saw him, when I was in China, and I looked reverently upon the back that was seamed and scarred with ``the marks of the Lord Jesus
I saw him, without any difficulty, from the Duchess of Grafton's box
I saw him, said the king, with a countenance full of fun, but I could not do any thing
I saw him--I knew him--Oh, Colonel Everard! He grasped Everard's hand with his own left hand, and pressed the palm of his right to his face and forehead, sobbing aloud
I saw him--accidentally--in Kensington Gardens, on Sunday, she answered at last
I saw him--he nodded to me
I saw him--he was riding a top log on the train
I saw him--just a glimpse of him--in your cab, and I took your number
I saw him--kiss--her--hand
I saw him; and he was very kind: and I am glad he is so, I having not wrote to him all the time, my eyes indeed not letting me
I saw him; and my childish attachment revived with double force
I saw him; and the ghastly spectre who now addresses you must not be ashamed to say, that she loved, and was beloved by, one of the handsomest youths in Scotland
I saw him; he had mittens on
I saw him; it was a vision, not a dream; my David is dead
I saw his Highness put his life in danger once to save a dog from drowning
I saw his Majesty return, he faltered--and M
I saw his abdominal parts distend with the plenitude of the repast until it had swollen to three times its former shrunken girth, when he flew away of his own accord laden with blood
I saw his anguish as, suddenly smiting his forehead, he turned abruptly to the window, and, looking upward at the placid sky, murmured passionately, 'O God, that I might die!' - and felt that to add one drop of bitterness to that already overflowing cup would be ungenerous indeed
I saw his arms raised, and after that I knew nothing more
I saw his back
I saw his blanch suddenly, even to the lips
I saw his body glint across the rising sun, swoop in a wonderful curve and land in a sheltering bush
I saw his bow
I saw his bright eyes and his brown face in the full light
I saw his bronzed and weather-beaten face flush when he caught sight of her in all her gracious beauty; but it was when she reached his side and laid her hand on his arm, as he told me afterward, that the choke came
I saw his brow begin to lower again, so the devil prompted me to advert, by way of changing the subject, to a file of newspapers, which, as it turned out, might have proved to be by far the most dangerous topic I could have hit upon
I saw his cabinet photograph in full uniform on the mantelpiece o' that cottage before faithful Fido turned up, Pyecroft whispered
I saw his calm eyes sometimes perk up
I saw his cap on the table! Lizzie laughed outright
I saw his card on the table when I came in
I saw his cave and house some years ago when, in company with General N
I saw his colonel, Lydiard, and the captain and sergeant of his company, who had from the first seen that he was a man of a higher class under a cloud, and had expected further inquiry, though, even from the little that had been seen of him, there was a readiness to take his word
I saw his countenance change
I saw his countenance darken, and all his hopes vanish, when he saw the prescriptions--his scepticism concerning medicines! nay, it is not enough scepticism! Yet, now that peas and beans are over, I have hopes that he will in good earnest make a fair and full trial
I saw his craft last night, down near Catskill, said Tom
I saw his crime, and I say this to you: let God be the sole judge among men, let Him be the only one to have the right over life, let no man ever think to take His place! But you in this instance-- No! interrupted Elias, guessing the objection
I saw his crimson face as he darted out and gripp'd her
I saw his cunning old eye on-cock
I saw his dark face lit up with a boyish enthusiasm as he gazed about him
I saw his death in the paper a month ago
I saw his error from the first; and I went on dreaming and singing; and now this night has come! Vittoria shadowed her eyes
I saw his evil eye resting on one and another of our group, as if he was storing up grudges to be well paid on future dark nights
I saw his eye brighten up at the prospect he had of doing a fellow-creature a kind turn or two, and he completely won my regard by an affability which I shall never forget
I saw his eye glance anxiously round, then he seemed reassured, and came towards me with some eagerness, greeting me with some compliment, I know not what, on my appearance; but I cut this as short as I could be saying: 'Know you, Monsieur, why I am here? I am come to ask you to bestow a little half-hour on one who is longing to see you
I saw his eye twinkle as they shuffled in and stood around the chair where the Captain was seated
I saw his eyebrows rise as he read
I saw his eyes fill with tears, and his hair--until then flamboyant and erect upon his head--fall down in limp disorder over his brow
I saw his eyes flash; he smiled at me, walked toward his office with a light step, as he always does when he's lucky, and then he swayed sideways and keeled over in a dead faint
I saw his eyes glisten when I told him that I had the money at home to do it with
I saw his eyes glittering
I saw his face
I saw his face clearly enough as he passed me
I saw his face darken as she whispered in his ear
I saw his face grow hard and the merciless glitter come into his eyes
I saw his face light up with exquisite tenderness, and I knew that he accepted this matin song of the bird as a message from his Maker
I saw his face plain in the moonlight; and the most resolute purpose showed in it, along with an unmoved composure
I saw his face quite distinctly and heard his abominable cough
I saw his face reflected in the mirror of my work-box
I saw his face set in an expression I well knew; but my mother laid a hand on his arm, and, with what must have been a great effort, he controlled his anger, and said coldly: I have talked this over with thy friend, Joseph Warder, and he desired that his son should share in my decision as to Hugh
I saw his face settle into sulky ugliness, and his great nether lip hanging down limp, which meant as if expressed in so many words, Well, get them to move yourself, you wicked hard man! I shall not help you
I saw his face soften with pity
I saw his face with the moonlight on it-- And with a few unbecoming scratches on it, too, from the underbrush and from those porch vines, chimed in a suave voice from the top of the stairs
I saw his face, and heard his voice, and felt the influence of his kind protecting manner in every line
I saw his face, and there was in it an indescribable heavenly sweetness and pity which made me say to my brother: 'I must go and hear him
I saw his face, as clearly as I see yours
I saw his face, however, and it was full of horror and astonishment
I saw his father's death in the paper last March
I saw his favourite yesterday, who complained to me that his highness had been absolutely refused admittance at your castle, notwithstanding he had made many ingenious, and some bold attempts, to see Lady Leonora L---- in the absence of her faithless husband
I saw his feelings were deeply affected, and I feared it would increase the fever, and I promised to come and see him again in a day or two
I saw his figure standing over me, outlined against the starry sky; and, deeply stirred, I listened with delight and wonder
I saw his finger uneasily going across and across his mouth during the whole of one long weary stage
I saw his foe fall back, his sword flying some feet away
I saw his footprint after the snow was melted
I saw his game, and declined to uncork him
I saw his gaze become suddenly fixed
I saw his ghastly and death-dewed features; his despairing yet defying look; the gloomy and impenetrable dungeon; the dying lamp, which seemed but to render darkness visible; and the horror-struck yet pitying expression of the priest's countenance; but there I lost my identity
I saw his glance take me in
I saw his gloom without knowing how to disperse it, but it did not make me particularly uncomfortable
I saw his gorge work as he subvocalized
I saw his grave, too, in the old churchyard beyond the Thiergarten gate
I saw his group of Hercules and Hebe, which had been spoken of with such enthusiasm in the Allgemeine Zeitung and other German papers, and which, through its antique repose, and its glorious beauty, powerfully seized upon me
I saw his haggard face, I heard again his voice, solicitous for Milly's grief
I saw his hand incline to his pocket
I saw his hand miss the door-knob by an inch, quickly fumble for it, and find it
I saw his hand touch the bulging coat-pocket with a swift, passing movement
I saw his hand with the dagger he held in it drop off, and then the man himself fell on me, and I was like to be stifled with his weight, when my preserver hauled him off me
I saw his hand, it grasped a knife, and sought for the spot where my heart lay; then it drove the blade in, slowly, slowly, and I awoke in unspeakable agony
I saw his hat moving along beside the fence; he went into the Zasyekins'
I saw his head come out and take a rapid glance at the windows
I saw his head for quite a long time craning out of the bog-hole, but it sucked him down at last
I saw his heart bestowed elsewhere
I saw his innocence by his surprise, and I whispered him the literal state of all he said; he was quite shocked, and coloured in his turn, apologising instantly to Colonel Manners, and protesting he had never heard of his personal ill usage, but only meant the defeat of his party
I saw his jackall t'other night in the meadows, the secretary at war, so emptily-important and distilling paragraphs of old news with such solemnity, that I did not know whether it was a man or the Utrecht gazette
I saw his lady, of whom the TERROE FILIUS of Oxford was once so merry; and two children, whereof one a very pretty little boy, like him, so fat and black
I saw his lean and lifted hand
I saw his lips move and his eyes cast up to heaven
I saw his lips move at the words I cancel the past,' though he did not speak them out
I saw his lips quiver as he spoke; and I think he durst not say anything more loving, for the purpose that was in his heart
I saw his lips shape, but not utter aloud, the single word pau (finish)
I saw his local newspaper neatly folded on the mantelpiece
I saw his lordship's face brighten
I saw his magnificent build, his superb muscular development, as with his body in profile, his head turned toward me, he waited before approaching, playing with my helplessness; but I was not entirely helpless! With shaking hand I took aim; I could not use my thumb to cock the revolver, but drew hard at the trigger, and the hammer rose and fell
I saw his man at dinner
I saw his mistake, and, raising my hand to check those behind, muttered in my beard that all had gone well
I saw his momentum was irresistible
I saw his mother with Friend Fairthorn
I saw his mother-in-law while I was there
I saw his name in the list of passengers
I saw his nice eyes getting so miserable
I saw his nostrils dilate, and his eyes flash
I saw his order
I saw his pale lips move for some time
I saw his pale, wandering eyes, his moth-white face
I saw his picture

I saw my chance, it is true, and took it
I saw my chap was crippled and I went back after the other, to keep him off you
I saw my children--and was neither permitted to clasp them to my heart, or to speak to them! You was leaning on the arm of your sister, and your countenances spoke the sprightly happy innocence of youth

I saw my father standing with his back towards me and his face still turned in the direction by which they had gone out

I saw my friends, my business associates, my tailor
I saw my ground was critical and that much depended on myself, so I quietly but audibly said, Yes, I did so, and shall do the same whenever I find the like; I have not toiled for two nights and days to save the property of the poor, the widow from affliction, and the orphan from wretchedness (I might have said more) and now for the sake of a few cartridges to allow more blood to be shed, when you have signed a peace

I saw my paragon glide away, like a goddess, past the scenery, and I did not see her meet her lover at the next step--a fellow with a wash-leather face, greasy locks in a sausage roll, and his hair shaved off his forehead--and snatch a pot of porter from his hands, and drain it to the dregs, and say, 'It is all right, Harry: <i>that</i> fetched 'em

I saw my seeds sprout, but what became of them afterwards I did not live to see

I saw my son in his bed, and blessed him, before I went to my own
I saw my soul a second time to-day; it was no longer the bubble, blown large, palpitating

I saw myself fascinating your aged father at the same time that you were fascinating George
I saw myself for the first time clearly, as I have been ever since I can remember--a crook, thoughtless, vain, rapacious, ruthless, skulking in shadows and thinking myself an amazingly fine fellow because, between coups, I would play the gentleman a bit, venture into the light and swagger in the haunts of the gratin

I saw myself seated in a kind of open stone summer-house at table; over my shoulder a hairy, bearded, and robed presence anointed me from an authentic shoe-horn; the summer-house was part of the green court of a ruin, and from the far side of the court black and white imps discharged against me ineffectual arrows

I saw myself this morning, a little way from the Ship, one of the Animals before spoke off; it was of a light mouse Colour and the full size of a Grey Hound, and shaped in every respect like one, with a long tail, which it carried like a Grey hound; in short, I should have taken it for a wild dog but for its walking or running, in which it jump'd like a Hare or Deer

I saw no more savages that day or the next; they probably had some sign by which they knew of the coming williwaws; at least, they were wise in not being afloat even on the second day, for I had no sooner gotten to work at sail-making again, after the anchor was down, than the wind, as on the day before, picked the sloop up and flung her seaward with a vengeance, anchor and all, as before

I saw no others of that species in the Hedjaz

I saw splinters fly from a bough to his right
I saw spunges, gratings, sweeps, hats, &c
I saw squads here, half-companies there; then three companies in an open space, wheeling with stately steps; a knot of drums and fifes near the railings unconcernedly slashing their way across popular airs; and a batch of gamins labouring through some extended attack destined to be swept aside by a corps crossing the ground at the double
I saw stains of blood on her gown-- Where? I interrupted
I saw starlight flash on the knife as it flew over the bulwark, then I heard it splash
I saw stars, but I've got over it, I guess
I saw strange figures of men and women, one on a kneeling camel, one on a crawling crocodile, and others differently mounted; with various besides of Nature's bizarre productions creeping and flying in stone-carving over the huge fire-place, in which, in place of a fire, stood several new and therefore brilliantly red cart-wheels

I saw that Margaret Wilmot's conduct was quite as inexplicable to him as it had been to me
I saw that Marryat, not less than Homer, Milton, and Virgil, profited by the choice of a familiar and legendary subject; so that he prepared his readers on the very title-page; and this set me cudgelling my brains, if by any chance I could hit upon some similar belief to be the centre-piece of my own meditated fiction

And we all started to run up the street, shouting: Death to the English spies! I was the hero of the expedition
I saw that by this way I was directed heavenwards, and that formerly I was going down to hell
I saw that chiropractic and osteopathic correction of spinal and pelvic lesions and consequent removal of irritation and pressure on the nerves, the cure of chronic constipation and malnutrition by pure food diet and hydrotherapy, the strengthening of the pelvic muscles and nerves by means of active and passive movements and exercises, were fully sufficient to correct the local symptoms in a natural manner
I saw that civilization was honeycombed with what Max Nordau called conventional lies, with sham ecstasy, sham sympathy, sham smiles, sham laughter The riot of prosperity introduced the fashion of respectable women covering their faces with powder and paint in a way that had hitherto been peculiar to women of the streets, so I pictured civilization as a harlot with cheeks, lips, and eyelashes of artificial beauty
I saw that clearly enough, and I tried to make Bobbie see it, when he was by way of pouring out his troubles to me one afternoon
I saw that clearly yesterday when I tried to rehearse it

I saw that girl at Campobello; I watched her
I saw that good and evil were fighting in her, and felt that no words of mine could be of further avail at the moment
I saw that hall filled in the early afternoon with an audience markedly masculine, listening to a lecture on early Greek life, interspersed with readings from the Homeric epics
I saw that hand take a dip of ink and write across the paper
I saw that handsome, proper young gentleman Babington, suffer in the Queen's time myself, and though I was then but a girl, he was in my head for a year after he was hanged
I saw that he attributed it to a general prejudice against his race and religion, and I perceived that this hurt his feelings much, though his pride or his philosophy quickly repressed his sensibility
I saw that he could bear no more
I saw that he could read, too, pretty well, for he presently drew my attention to a very old book indeed, that lay on a shelf, a little Roman Catholic missal with tarnished gold clasps and scarlet edges
I saw that he did not believe my explanation
I saw that he did not know her in the least, as he advanced to my mother, as the lady of the house, and in one moment I recollected how my grandfather had fallen in love with my grandmother without knowing she was his life
I saw that he did not mean to drop out of the game
I saw that he did not recognise me, but the desire to confess my offending was irresistible
I saw that he didn't know me and then, suddenly as I sat, holding my cards, and he stood beside me, he noticed a tiny scar on my shoulder
I saw that he drew her hair back, and that then he parted it, to examine her scalp, and I wondered what infinitesimal clue might be the object of his search
I saw that he followed me in one of these, and I said that I knew what his hours were, and I was watching so that I might go away in time, and then he sweetly protested
I saw that he genuinely admitted my prowess; and where he formerly envied me, he now took great pride in all I accomplished, and claimed that it was but his own brains acting through my body

I saw that he had arrived in one of his peppery moods
I saw that he had been drinking, and was not in a very amiable mood
I saw that he had been wounded
I saw that he had forgotten himself, and that he knew it
I saw that he had left all for this work
I saw that he had my bill for the sleigh-ride in his hand
I saw that he had not forgotten the smallest matter of detail
I saw that he lived again in his daughter; <i>his</i> was the smile that closed up the eyes, as hers did; had Mimsey ever smiled in those days, I should have known her again by this very characteristic trait
I saw that he looked first concerned and then thoughtful
I saw that he loved her, perhaps, without a consciousness himself of the unhappy truth
I saw that he observed me from time to time attentively, and I thought he wanted to discover whether there was within me any remains of my old antipathies
I saw that he really meant it, so I climbed back on the seat
I saw that he signed his name as Weltz on the slips
I saw that he smiled, two or three evenings back, when I told Robert at supper that I wanted him to go out with me, and I was rarely angry, I can tell you
I saw that he spoke to the Lady Helen
I saw that he thought I had left home because I had been guilty of some wildness, if not of some crime, and I feared that my story would prove so inoffensive that he would think I was holding something back
I saw that he thought of his son,--that mysterious son! And looking at him tenderly, I observed that his deep lines had grown deeper, his iron-gray hair more gray
I saw that he took note of this before he pointed to that corner of the veranda most closely screened by the vines and said: May the table be placed yonder? Certainly; I often have it there, even when I am alone
I saw that he trusted me, and I felt fearless as a bull-dog
I saw that he was a man of unfaltering courage, and that the instincts of a gentleman had not entirely left him, soiled as he was with every crime
I saw that he was a master in the art of make-up
I saw that he was a thin man and tall, straight in the figure, but his head began to sink into his shoulders and not very steady on them
I saw that he was alone--and that at once brought before my mind the picture of Virginia, the brave and passionate dark-browed girl, my stormy lover and my wife; whom I, alas, was hired by gratitude and the sacrament to love, though love her as I ought I did not
I saw that he was as matchless in beauty as in terror
I saw that he was as much abashed by our encounter as I was; he was visibly shy to the point of discomfort, but in no ignoble sense was he conscious, and as nearly as he could with one so much his younger he made an absolute equality between us
I saw that he was brooding, and was not noticing the voices, which presently died away
I saw that he was deceiving us
I saw that he was deeply moved, and I wished fervently, now that it was too late, that I had told him of the street fight at the time, and not allowed him to hear of it from others
I saw that he was dodging me, so
I saw that he was evidently a clergyman; but what his tight silk stockings and peculiar hat denoted I did not know
I saw that he was excited and nervously unstrung when he came in, but I did not fully realize it until he began to hang his hat on the smooth wall
I saw that he was going out of his way to accompany me, notwithstanding the long walk that was yet before him; and, fearing that he might be inconveniencing himself from motives of politeness, I observed--'I fear I am taking you out of your way'
I saw that he was good
I saw that he was grievously wounded, as he walked slowly, and upon arrival at a thickly-spreading mimosa he lay down
I saw that he was hesitating, but at last he spoke out
I saw that he was impressed by the handsome exterior of my friend; and in private, making known the case, he faithfully promised to do his best for him; though the times, he said, were quite dull
I saw that he was in a profound slumber
I saw that he was in a stirred, excited mood, and the key to it was soon found
I saw that he was in fact in a bad way, but his condition did not indicate any pressing danger, and I had the presentiment that he would still, as the saying is, put up a good fight
I saw that he was leading these men through dark ways of disappointment and misery, the cure of their own wrong-doing, to find this door and find him
I saw that he was looking about, and I prepared for questions, and wondered what they would be
I saw that he was no longer a dreamer; his face was firm with a great resolve
I saw that he was not merely mortified by my words, but was on the point of violently resenting them as a personal insult
I saw that he was not pleased
I saw that he was of short stature and slight figure
I saw that he was rather worried over the order home and I expressed my sympathy as well as I could, hoping everything would turn out for the best
I saw that he was still distracted by doubts
I saw that he was thumbing a copy of the scenario, or detailed working manuscript of the story, making notations in some kind of little book, and it was that which enabled me to establish his identity at a glance
I saw that he was too hardened for any words of mine to influence him
I saw that he was troubled greatly, and I felt his helplessness
I saw that he was under conviction and one evening I got to him before he had left, and I asked him if he did not want to get saved and he told me, Yes
I saw that he was watching the two girls at the forward table closely and so I faced about to follow his glance
I saw that he was, and I believe I should have dropped if you had not come up and saved me
I saw that he wished to be left alone and retired as gracefully as I could, determined to employ the time in watching the others
I saw that he wished to get away and had not spoken seriously
I saw that heaven meant us a mischief and said, 'You force me to yield, for you are many against one, but at any rate each one of you must take his solemn oath that if he meet with a herd of cattle or a large flock of sheep, he will not be so mad as to kill a single head of either, but will be satisfied with the food that Circe has given us
I saw that her cheek was bleeding as well as her foot
I saw that her curiosity was aroused and that she was eager to provide herself with a trump-card for the next meeting
I saw that her eyes were dancing,--in a manner of speaking, her looks brightened under the sunshine of her father's displeasure
I saw that her face was badly tattooed, but her body was not, and as she stood there, apparently undecided what to do, she was to me an object of pity, and her dejected countenance would, I think, have appealed strongly to even Jim Bridger's heart
I saw that her face was very pale
I saw that her present position must be a trial
I saw that his big, patient eyes were overfull as he spoke
I saw that his cheeks had paled, and that his hand trembled as he handed the paper over to me
I saw that his conscience was speaking, and I knew he was the last in the world to succeed in excusing himself
I saw that his face was covered with blood; I learned later that he had three teeth knocked out, and his nose broken
I saw that his family were moving heaven and earth to break off his engagement with me, and it evidently pained him deeply that he must so greatly disappoint his parents
I saw that his fingers were grasping a fork desperately; the tips of his fingers were white, the rest of the hand was violet
I saw that his hair had whitened noticeably in the last two months
I saw that his love for me had awakened his soul
I saw that his must indeed be a complex nature
I saw that his partner had not spoken to him about the Comdie Franaise
I saw that his position on the old parchment was impregnable
I saw that his silence was nothing but ill-humour
I saw that hour, the way made plain, to do With scarce an effort what had seemed a strife That would require the strength of my whole life
I saw that if I could not bring him to the point, he would dangle about me for years, and perhaps, at last, succeed in irritating me to rudeness
I saw that if I put him on the defensive I should have him at advantage, for he had not that art of the true swordsman, the prescient quality which foretells the opponents action and stands prepared
I saw that if he suspected me I was lost; I answered that I did not think that he meant me to leave Paris and my family
I saw that if his mind was not relieved in some way he would die
I saw that if it was so hard for me then when I was not much more than a kid it would be harder for her if I let her grow up caring, and then we had to be parted, so I decided to make the break
I saw that if we remained in the carriage it must be broken in pieces, as our weight must insure its destruction
I saw that if we wanted a complete view we must climb to the top of a peak which, though only a few hundred feet higher than where we were lying, nevertheless hid a great deal from us
I saw that in a moment they would come to blows
I saw that in her face, said Despard, which I hardly dare acknowledge to myself
I saw that in him I had found not only a capable and trustworthy man, but a good comrade as well; and this was a point of the highest importance
I saw that in his avoidance of
I saw that in my writings I laughed vainly, for nothing, myself not knowing why
I saw that in the first half minute
I saw that indeed he was quite done for with amazement, so I ran him a bath and procured him a dish of tea
I saw that instantly she had determined to conceal her own wishes, to obliterate herself entirely, to let me know that, so far as she could affect my choice, I was a free agent
I saw that it was a staff officer, doubtless carrying some despatch to headquarters
I saw that it was adulterate
I saw that it was all he could do to keep from winking; but he did
I saw that it was all right for you as well as me, that you had not sunk, that you had risen in his esteem
I saw that it was all up with our animals
I saw that it was best to let him speak his mind
I saw that it was hardly kind to ask him
I saw that it was in virtue of this, that, again to use the words of Novalis, 'the mystery was unsealed
I saw that it was inscribed with Hebraic-looking characters as unlike as possible to the scrawl of a little child
I saw that it was necessary I should take some profession
I saw that it was necessary to change the mode of attack, and directed some trees to be cut down and trimmed, to be used as battering rams
I saw that it was no use grousing at fate and that it was better for me not to go into the American wilderness, since a rolling stone gathers no moss
I saw that it was not going to be possible to drive through the jam, so I put my car in a parking place, and set out for the City Hall on foot
I saw that it was not only transgression against myself, but against the eternal decrees of the Most High
I saw that it was of excellent workmanship, and I was about to hand it back to him, almost persuaded that I had made a mistake, when in a second my doubts were solved
I saw that it was of no use to argue, but I didn't like it
I saw that it was one of the most urgent questions on the Agenda
I saw that it was quite a DEMONSTRATION that I drank up the tea unhesitatingly
I saw that it was the young man whom we had noticed
I saw that it was their determination not to call the meeting; as they said it was impossible to carry resolutions and a petition for Reform in a city which was under such a corrupt influence
I saw that it was up with us, so far as the old uns were concerned; and it might be worth while to find out if the young uns really were dead
I saw that it wasn't likely to do much damage, so I didn't ride back to tell Billee and the others
I saw that it would be better to suggest than to reason
I saw that it would be imprudent if I should speak my sentiments openly to a man who after my departure should command all those who remained in the country

I saw that the child enjoyed the breast very much, and that it did not give the mother so much pain as I had apprehended; and my mind was, therefore, more resolved than ever to carry this point; although I had never before had to contend with such powerful antagonists as the gossips, who affected to treat my knowledge upon such matters with ridicule, and my interference in them as preposterous and indecent

I saw the figures in that geography
I saw the fire as I was riding back, and I thought you'd be here
I saw the fire shine upon her hair and vanish in her breast

I saw the poor, and the degraded, and the racked, and the priest-ridden, tillers and peoplers of the soil, which made the substance beneath the glittering and false surface,--the body of that vast empire, of which I had hitherto beheld only the face, and THAT darkly, and for the most part covered by a mask

I saw the position at once, and was dumfounded
I saw the president
I saw the priest, and an attendant with a large taper, and a man, and a woman, and some others; but I had no more idea, until the ceremony was all over, that it was a baptism, or that the curious little stiff instrument, that was passed from one to another, in the course of the ceremony, by the handle--like a short poker--was a child, than I had that it was my own christening

I saw the prisoner there
I saw the procession and the hall; but the return was in the dark
I saw the procession pass along the street, spread far apart so that they took up much space crossways, but close behind one another: goldsmiths, painters, stonecutters, broiderers, sculptors, joiners, carpenters, sailors, fishermen, butchers, leather workers, cloth makers, bakers, tailors, shoemakers, and all kinds of craftsmen and workmen who work for their livelihood

I saw the rats leaving in Jamaica--taking up their line of march, like marines on the fore

I saw the regiments pass at a distance, the colonel said, and they marched in good order, too, which is more than I have seen any other Portuguese troops do
I saw the remains of a Dasypoid quadruped from the Arroyo Seco, close to M

I saw the rhinoceros pelting away about a hundred and twenty yards ahead, and spurring hard, I shot up to him at full speed until within twenty yards, when round he came with astonishing quickness and charged straight at the horse
I saw the rich marsh-land in its summer luxuriance, and made with Rantzau several interesting little excursions
I saw the riders dash towards an animal who 'needed branding'--which I discovered to mean one that had hitherto escaped the iron, or that had changed owners--throw a rope over its head or horns, fasten the other end to the pommel, and drag it to the fire, where it was thrown and tied
I saw the ring at his own bungalow and on his own finger, reiterated Elaine positively

I saw the rock he dived from at Huahoa
I saw the round sun shadows upon the grass, the sparkling, gently flowing Thames, the white swans, the gaily crowded boats, the kindly, happy people about me, and in their midst, as the sunny kernel of joy, the wavy, golden hair of her whom I loved best, and who only lent the true radiance to all this summer glory

I saw the smoke issuing from his lips as he slowly turned his head and glanced out over the water in my direction
I saw the smoke of a native fire rising in the plains
I saw the smoke, The unintelligible shock of hosts that still, Far off, unseeing, strove and strove again; And Beauty flying naked down the hill From morn to eve: and the stern night cried Peace!

I saw the survivors of the Johnstown flood when the horror of that disaster was still plainly written in their eyes, but destitute as they were of home and food and clothing, they were in better plight than those fever-stricken, starving pacficos, who have sinned in no way, who have given no aid to the rebels, and whose only crime is that they lived in the country instead of in the town
I saw the swaggering turcos in their scarlet breeches, the crowded troop-ships, and from every ship's mast the glorious tri-color of France; the flag that in ten short years had again risen, that was flying over advancing columns in China, in Africa, in Madagascar; over armies that for Alsace Lorraine were giving France new and great colonies on every seaboard of the world

I saw thee in a light not of earth, and thou wert transparent as the light
I saw thee late at the Count Orsino's
I saw thee late at the Count Orsino's Clo
I saw thee lovely and I wished thee mine, And the last song I ever wrote is thine
I saw thee once--once only--years ago: I must not say how many--but not many
I saw thee sit there in disconsolate sighs, Where the hall of thy fathers a ruined heap lies
I saw thee washing sheep last night, On the bridge I stood with marble brow
I saw thee weep before the gates and 'plain, v
I saw thee yesterday in the street, and thou wert as the ghost of thine old gladness; although belike thou hast striven with sorrow; for I see thee with a sword by thy side, and we have been told that thou, O fairest of women, hast given thyself to the Warrior to be his damsel

I saw thee, O thou best of all the human race, display, i
I saw thee, and that bound thee to Me; thou shalt see Me, and that will confirm the bond
I saw thee, whilst thou wast little; and, if it please Allah the Most High, I will repay thee somewhat of the kindness thy father did me
I saw thee,' 'Thou shalt see Me
I saw thee--I knew thee, as I took hold of thee, insensible
I saw their approach, in return, with lively Page 259 pleasure, for, the quay being, I suppose, a place of certain security, they were unencumbered by their usual turnkeys, the gendarmes, and this freedom, joined to their surprise at my sight, put them also off their guard, and they flocked round though not near me, and hailed me with smiles, bows, and hands put upon their breasts
I saw their captain go into your hut twice
I saw their chief, says Moran, tall as a rock of ice
I saw their eager faces and Virginia's considering look
I saw their eyes like phosphorus, blue fog about them wove
I saw their eyes restlessly courting attention
I saw their eyes stick out a yard
I saw their fire dance the other night, began Tad
I saw their happiness, so brief, So exquisite,--her error, too, That easy trust, that prompt belief In what the warm heart wishes true; That faith in words, when kindly said
I saw their ingenuity
I saw their limbs quivering between his teeth
I saw their linked arms--the compliant, willing movements of their mutual forms--and dark were the images of guilt and hateful suspicion which entered my brain and grew to vivid forms, in action before me
I saw their literary manager; he said he was going to read it himself
I saw their little jealousies at the distinguished attention he paid me
I saw their long black shadows, The beeches in the lane, The gray church in the meadows And my white cottage--plain
I saw their meeting--their long exchange of looks
I saw their park, their pleasure-ground, beyond through the wood, in Spaulding's cranberry-meadow
I saw their point: it was to intimidate me by their strength and frightful appearance; and I perceived the chief, too, was somewhat under the influence of rum
I saw their real power, their real dignity, their real responsibility in the world; and then the way they dress and behave used to make me fairly frantic
I saw their rip-snorting boys ride past the store
I saw their starved lips in the gloam With horrid warning gaped wide, And I awoke and found me here, On the cold hill's side
I saw their starved lips in the gloam, With horrid warning gaped wide, And I awoke, and found me here On the cold hill side
I saw their trunks at the station, said Jack and they were tagged to The Burrow
I saw their two faces very distinctly, and I knew that I could recognise them anywhere
I saw them
I saw them a few weeks ago, not yet arranged, leaning up against the wall with very battered and dilapidated glories; the recumbent Christ was standing more or less on end, and the whole group was in a pathetic state of dismemberment that will doubtless soon make way for a return to their earlier arrangement
I saw them aboard the train; she played her part admirably, I will say that for her
I saw them across the field where the road turns
I saw them again
I saw them again next day
I saw them all in a picture at home, of a beautiful lady sailing in a car drawn by dolphins, and babies flying round her, and one sitting in her lap; and the mermaids swimming and playing, and the mermen trumpeting on conch-shells; and it is called 'The Triumph of Galatea;' and there is a burning mountain in the picture behind
I saw them all looking at me
I saw them all that night, and read in their eyes the fire of an unalterable resolution
I saw them all there sitting at a table, and the master at the head of it
I saw them all, Peter, and a goodly sight it was--what between paint, and medals, and bows and arrows and tomahawks, and all your bravery! You like to see him, eh? Yes; he fine t'ing to look at
I saw them also, replied Bearwarden, but took them to be swarms of microbes waiting to destroy your body, or perhaps trying in vain to penetrate your hermetically sealed coffin
I saw them arm in arm glide rather than walk
I saw them arrive on the evening when I myself took possession, and they arrived with the flat pint of beer, and their bed in a bundle
I saw them as I rode up
I saw them as I was on the way here, and I had to go into a mud puddle to get them
I saw them as clearly as I see you, and I used to weep when they departed, and would fain that they should have taken me with them
I saw them as if something bound them; I stood there but my heart went round them
I saw them as plainly as I see you
I saw them as something that I could not bear to see, and I cried out that from that hour I would change them
I saw them as they came out on the main road
I saw them as you stooped over my bed this morning
I saw them at Sumas Lake May 17th, 1904
I saw them at Wilno
I saw them at a distance, was overcome with confusion, and was just going to leave my work, to run and hide myself
I saw them at almost every stop,--German soldiers from Tsing-tau to Kiao-chou, British from Tong-ku to Peking, French from Peking to Paoting-fu, etc
I saw them at first making their way round the doubling-post, but now, though I search the plain of Troy, I cannot find them
I saw them at home, not many months ago, in my father's library
I saw them at night; and the next day I watched again--waiting about the street, and hiding myself under porches or in shops, when there was any chance of my being seen
I saw them at once
I saw them at the front door as I came in
I saw them at the theatre the other night
I saw them at their best, of course--at balls, tea-parties and the like
I saw them at their feed
I saw them begin in Gridley
I saw them blundering with their tongue and their words as children who have their first paint box and get as much color smeared over their dresses, hands and faces as on the paper
I saw them board the train
I saw them both taken to be tried
I saw them by accident,--we were not together
I saw them carry him off myself, sir, again deliberately said the corporal
I saw them chaps out there, standin' by the menagerie doors, said the contortionist
I saw them climb down the rocky steps; and presently they were lost to view
I saw them climb on the wall and play together, obliviously and exquisitely, in the darkening air
I saw them come out and go in
I saw them coming along the road, and I was afraid that he had another nasty frog
I saw them coming
I saw them coming up within me, and I heard what they said, every word, yes really, every word! This were not thoughts, but characters, genuine beings, which did not seem to have anything in common with me, and yet they were identical with me
I saw them confident, grave, with their answers swift
I saw them continually, and never passed a day without calling at the royal abode by the queen's express permission ; and during the whole period of their stay, my invalid appeared to be stationary in his health
I saw them dancing what I took to be the tarantella a moment ago
I saw them depart with cheerfulness, freely risking their lives
I saw them depart with envy, and to add to my annoyance I shortly fell ill of a violent attack of measles
I saw them devour each other with their eyes
I saw them disappear and hauled on the warp hand-over-hand with all my might, Lady Waldon leaning over to strike at my hands until I shouted to Fred to come and hold her
I saw them down in the hollow
I saw them drag her away--that is all I know
I saw them dragging on into old age, with the spine of life broken, mutilated and mauled
I saw them draw back, leaving men on the pavement,
I saw them during the three days at Paris, mingled with canaille and gamins behind the barriers, whilst the mitraille was flying in all directions, and the desperate cuirassiers were dashing their fierce horses against these seemingly feeble bulwarks
I saw them embark to pass the mighty river, and never will that solemn spectacle fade from my remembrance
I saw them enter the room, and heard the words of surprise
I saw them eventually seek rest on rustic chairs where their conversation deepened into the relations they sustained one to the other, succeeded at last by a tender, thoughtful silence
I saw them fall, just by the big stone
I saw them fidgeting about for some time, and trying to tuck their legs under them, after the fashion of European tailors
I saw them first at their work (basket-making, and the manufacture of palm-leaf hats), afterwards in their school, where they sang a chorus in praise of Liberty: an odd, and, one would think, rather aggravating, theme for prisoners
I saw them five years ago, when they hung from the walls, tattered and covered with dust; they are now enclosed in glass cases, to which the stranger's attention is eagerly directed by the boys who swarm around him
I saw them flash
I saw them for I was wandering about wishing for Laurel, and I remember it all
I saw them for an instant
I saw them from the window, but I didn't ask them any questions
I saw them get out of the carriage at Neuilly, without for an instant suspecting the risk they had run
I saw them get smaller and smaller, till they became two black, hovering little specks that vanished round the bend
I saw them give him some vicious bumps against the walls as they went out of the door into the village, where they dropped him into the first pool of mud, which represented the village horse-pond

I saw them go down there
I saw them go off with Happy, beating it for all they were worth toward the wings
I saw them go out to the yacht of that Professor Arnold
I saw them go toward the other end of the garden, where I had last been seen, and begin searching about
I saw them go, he said
I saw them go: one horse was blind, The tails of both hung down behind, Their shoes were on their feet
I saw them going on board just as I left the house to come up to you
I saw them here wading about in search of food -- probably for the worms which burrow in the mud; and these latter probably feed on infusoria or confervae

I saw them in Fourteenth street, coming in town from north
I saw them in a barnyard
I saw them in a loud laugh of triumph at the ravings they had occasioned
I saw them in desperately tight corners, fighting in ruined villages with sword and bayonet
I saw them in great numbers off Barkley Sound migrating north
I saw them in the automobile as I came out of the building and went my way after Elizabeth Bransone had told me to my face--I managed to get in to see her--had told me that I was a sight, a disgrace, that she couldn't bear to look at me, and that I had better clear out before her husband came in
I saw them in the lightning
I saw them in the moonlight, armed with rifles and tomahawks, and frightfully painted
I saw them in their curious nests, close couching, slyly peer With their wild eyes, like glittering beads, to note if harm were near; I passed them by, and blessed them all; I felt that it was good To leave unmoved the creatures small whose home was in the wood
I saw them in town in their way to Castle Howard
I saw them in your fingers
I saw them instinctively, as in a dream
I saw them just a minute ago

I saw them leave together
I saw them leaving the dining-room, he reported to us in the laboratory directly afterward
I saw them lift Cousin Willie into a closed black wagon that stood at the street door with quite a little crowd of people gathered about it already, all excited and leering as if it were a show
I saw them lift her up
I saw them looking rather curiously at each other and then the center inquisitor fired a lot of questions at me, in answer to which I only shrugged my shoulders

I saw them marching past with some more of the boys and the redcoats early this morning
I saw them meet
I saw them meself, sorr
I saw them miles ahead along the straight, waiting in the teak
I saw them mount their camels! I took off my turban, unrolled it, and waved it in the air
I saw them myself conveyed to the prison at -
I saw them myself in a magazine at home
I saw them myself in the morning; the little one was driving four ponies, and with an amount of audacity! I bowed to them; did they mention me? Did they recognize me? When will you take me to Longueval? Answer me
I saw them myself in their boats, and sent that intelligence to General Greene as soon as possible, as every other thing I heard of
I saw them myself--right near Brantford
I saw them neither cut nor convey the timbers along, but it is to be presumed their manner is the same as that of other Beavers, who never cut but a soft wood; for which purpose they use their fore-teeth, which are extremely sharp
I saw them not
I saw them on a school globe, the outlines of Asia and the Pacific Ocean! In a second I had become too weak to stand, and I sank trembling upon a bench
I saw them on many occasions returning in countless numbers from a foray, each carrying in its mouth a grain of barley or wheat
I saw them on the street to-day, and they won't do
I saw them on your bureau yesterday and started to throw them out of the window
I saw them once at the mill
I saw them once more go to the ship, and return soon after with an old man, who led in his hand a handsome lad of about fourteen or fifteen years of age
I saw them once; and, at first, thought they were animals, and not human beings
I saw them only in that part of Peru, between Amotape and Coquimbo, on the shores of the Pacific
I saw them others wouldn't do
I saw them over on the other side, across the abyss from me, grouped smiling about this new-comer, praising his brute ability to drink and race and wrestle, complimenting him upon his position among the gentry--save the mark!--of Tryon County, and proud that they had by never so little aided him to secure for a wife this poor trembling, timid, fascinated girl
I saw them passing as we came
I saw them pause--concentrate their glances and fix them straight and full upon mine
I saw them perish--all perish
I saw them plain enough,' answered Brian, moodily
I saw them plain, and they had grey eyes, and their screens upon their heads were of the Drummed colours
I saw them play that match at Brighton, I mentioned just now, a few days ago
I saw them playing on the floor, said Nan
I saw them read computers with antennas

I saw them safe to London myself, or I should have known of my brother's illness and have been here before this
I saw them selling it on the street yesterday
I saw them sent for by some people and enter an inn, in a pretty good hurry: what it was for I do not know

I saw them stumbling lamely down the road on their last journey together, walking side by side without touch or speech, seeing and heeding nothing but a blank future
I saw them tanning leather; they took the skin and put something on it, I do not know what it was, and put it in the sun for a few days, then with a small sharp iron fastened on a long handle, they scraped the skin with this until very smooth, and greased it over and put it in the sun again for some time, afterwards two squaws pulled it until nice and soft, and then it was ready for use
I saw them the day Nurse and I went to market
I saw them then, and if I do not see them now, I am not so old or so foolish as to doubt that they are there
I saw them this morning
I saw them this morning on first getting the news
I saw them through an open window
I saw them through the window
I saw them together at Levi Coffin's, in Cincinnati, happy in their freedom
I saw them together but once, and it seemed passing strange that this incident should be the one remembered in connection with the name

I saw them turn the corner to their right into Pearl-Dealers Lane
I saw them turn up the road to Green Fancy, so that knocks your ghost story all to smash, Bacon

I saw them when I had my eight days' leave
I saw them when they met, and I'm sure they had never laid eyes on each other before

I saw them whilst the black blood roll'd adown Each stern face, even then with dauntless eye Scowl round contemptuous, dying as they lived, Fearless of fate! (Loud and repeated Applauses)
I saw them wink at him, to induce him to say that Jurand was the first to begin the fight
I saw them with my bodily eyes, as I see you, she said to her judges, and when they departed from me I wept, and well I wished that they had taken me with them
I saw them with my eyes closed, and I heard them by day and night; they interrupted my work; they woke me from my sleep

I saw them! The damage amounted to seventeen rupees, eight annas
I saw them, Adam--Winter showed the nursery to me while they were gathering courage to receive me in the drawing-room
I saw them, And carried hither and yon through the smoke, and torn and bloody; And at last but a few shreds of the flags left on the staffs, (and all in silence,) And the staffs all splintered and broken
I saw them, and heard the bursting of doors, and the screams of women
I saw them, and they looked terrible hungry
I saw them, and thought of her, all the way back to the station, but not an inch further
I saw them, as a boy, almost day by day, and recorded the meteors in the evening
I saw them, but I do not know who they are
I saw them, but they would not listen, and now they are paying for their folly
I saw them, doing battle on the lake shore
I saw them, going down the churchyard, and bellowed after them with all my lungs
I saw them, the last green thing, in the autumn; and here they are again, the first in the spring

I saw them; terrible--horrible--sheathed in iron from top to toe
I saw then by a sudden burst of flame from the castle that they were carrying something heavy, and I guessed what it was although my heart rebelled against belief; but I did not dare leave Mahmoud, who seemed inclined to take advantage of the first stray opportunity
I saw then in my dream so far as this valley reached, there was on the right hand a very deep ditch: that ditch is it into which the blind have led the blind in all ages, and have both there miserably perished (Psa
I saw then in my dream, that they went on in this their solitary ground, till they came to a place at which a man is apt to lose his way
I saw then in my dream, that they went till they came into a certain country, whose air naturally tended to make one drowsy, if he came a stranger into it
I saw then that I had set my brokers bidding against each other for the same stock
I saw then that it had no wings
I saw then that she was making his shirts! It made me both hot and cold at once
I saw then that the unusually forlorn and stunted look of the house was partly due to the loss of what is known in New England as the L: that long deep-roofed adjunct usually built at right angles to the main house, and connecting it, by way of storerooms and tool-house, with the wood-shed and cow-barn
I saw then that though her face was so bright and full of color, her hand was thin and transparent

I saw there Lord Masham's children

I saw there a young lady rising from her seat, and accelerated my steps
I saw there about two or three and twenty young women, most of them well habited, on their knees very busy, as if they had been weeding

I saw there also certain kind having only one horn in the midst of the forehead, as hath the unicorn, and about a span of length, but the horn bendeth backward: they are of bright shining red colour
I saw there also two great censers each big as a mazer-bowl, flaming with lign-aloes, nadd- perfume, ambergris and honied scents; and the place was full of their fragrance
I saw there at their sports and at their songs A beauty smiling, which the gladness was Within the eyes of all the other saints; And if I had in speaking as much wealth As in imagining, I should not dare To attempt the smallest part of its delight
I saw there books treating of trade and commerce, of arms and armor, and machines for the assault and defence of cities, of military engineering, and the conduct of armies in grand campaigns, of engineering not military, dealing with surveying, and the construction of highways, aqueducts, and bridges, and the laying out of towns
I saw there many women, dressed without regard to the season or the demands of the place, in apery, or, as it looked, in mockery, of European fashions
I saw there no longer a snuffy, repulsive old woman, but a human being about to make that mysterious journey a far country whence there is no return
I saw there one small formation of sandstone or conglomerate; but no secondary limestone, and no trace of petrifactions
I saw there some rocks of the same basaltic tufwacke which I met with in the Djebel el Hasz and in ome of the districts of Haouran
I saw there the Astronomy and Astronomical Tables of Ibn Junis, and with them a silver globe perfected from the calculations of Almamon the Kaliph, which helps us to the geographical principle not yet acknowledged in Rome, that the earth is round
I saw there the Book of the Balance of Wisdom by Alhazan, who delved into the laws of nature until there is nothing phenomenal left
I saw there the Philosophy of Azazzali the Arab, for which both Christian and Moslem should be grateful, since it has given Philosophy its true place by exalting it into a handmaiden of Religion
I saw there the clergy of all denominations uniting in prayer, at a ceremony such as the present, celebrating the erection of new buildings for a college, free to all, but under Presbyterian direction
I saw there the first section of kitchen-middens--that is, the refuse of oyster shells, fish-bones, and other stuff thrown out by the ancient inhabitants of the country after their meals; together with accumulations of rude stone implements, kelts, arrow-heads, and such like
I saw there the mask and head-dress to be worn in a play of mine by the player who will speak the part of Cuchulain, and who wearing this noble half-Greek half-Asiatic face will appear perhaps like an image seen in revery by some Orphic worshipper
I saw there three seedling pear-trees, three seedling apple trees, a little plum-tree about three feet high, with seven bad plums on it, a vine some thirty feet long, with nine bunches of grapes, some of them withered, or rotten, and some partly ripe, about forty plants of French melons and a few pumpkins

I saw there was no feeling of enthusiasm amongst the people; they looked first at the exhibited M

I saw there was something wrong with you from the start which needed breaking up
I saw there were just fifty dollars; then I looked at the note and saw it had been given about five years before
I saw there were three men in her, the officer replied, but I couldn't see their faces or the colour of their clothes, for it was very dark; and if it had not been for the two great lamps at the jeweller's on the bridge, I should not have seen so much as I did
I saw there, besides dictionaries Greek, Latin, and Hebrew, the Encyclopaedia of Sciences, a rare and wonderful volume by a Granadian Moor, Ibn Abdallah

I saw therefore that he that hath gifts had need be let into a sight of the nature of them, to wit, that they come short of making of him to be in a truly saved condition, lest he rest in them, and so fall short of the grace of God
I saw therefore that he that hath gifts, had need be let into a sight of the nature of them, to wit, that they come short of making of him to be in a truly saved condition, lest he rest in them, and so fall short of the grace of God
I saw therein a moral world, charred and ruined, as, in some fable I have read, the world of the moon is described to be; yet withal it was a brain of magnificent formation
I saw these drawings in preparation on board the Carpathia, and said at the time that they bore no resemblance to what actually happened
I saw these foul slanders crystallizing into history, uncontradicted by friends who knew her personally, who, firm in their own knowledge of her virtues, and limited in view as aristocratic circles generally are, had no idea of the width of the world they were living in, and the exigency of the crisis
I saw these grisly birds sitting expectantly in rows on the coping of the towers, and the sight was almost too gruesome
I saw these hills for the first time in the Wady Darkaynlay: in the interior they are larger and longer than near the maritime regions
I saw these plants when the capsules were nearly mature, and their curious arrangement at once brought full conviction to the mind that an immense advantage had been derived from crossing these hybrids
I saw these prisoners: instead of twelve hundred desperadoes, they consisted of about twenty poor lame ragged wretches, many of them boys from fourteen to sixteen years of age
I saw these tired, sad hunters gather the scattered bones and relics of their tribe in a large circle, placing plenty of furs and food, with pipes, beads and arrows in the center, and cover them high with stones and earth that wild beasts could not move
I saw these two highly-gifted and amiable brothers almost daily; the circles into which I was invited seemed also to be theirs, and it was my desire and pleasure that they should listen to my little stories, that they should participate in them, they whose names will be always spoken as long as the German <i>Volks M rchen</i> are read
I saw these walls, this carpet; and I heard, As now, his measured step in the next chamber, Go pacing up and down, and I shut out! He is too good for me, I weak for him

I saw they got on much better together, and I think she was aware of the relationship
I saw they wanted to get out, so I went and held their horse for them, and they got down and went into the house
I saw they was starting for me, so I just slung in a 'Thank you something awful, boss,' and ducked through and between, and cut for life; 'cause if they'd a-got me, I might a-been there yet
I saw they were Fans, as indeed nearly all the crew were, but I did not think much of the affair
I saw they were dress'd for a masquerade train, Colour'd rags upon sticks they all brandish'd in view, And of such idle things they seem'd mightily vain, Though they nothing display'd but a bird split in two
I saw they were getting on well together, and let things take their course
I saw they were not as was thought, They themselves were fully at rest, they suffer'd not, The living remain'd and suffer'd, the mother suffer'd, And the wives and the child and the musing comrade suffer'd, And the armies that remain'd suffer'd
I saw they were robbers, so I caught a few of them, and ate them of course

I saw things from the outside formerly
I saw things weren't well with him, but I asked no question till something dropped by himself made, as it had made on another occasion, an absence of curiosity invidious
I saw things with different eyes: formerly I used, like my companions, to be ready enough to take any advantage that lay in my way of my employer; but my gratitude to him who had befriended me in my helpless state wrought such a change in me, that I now took part with my master on all occasions, and could not bear to see him wronged--so gratitude first made me honest
I saw things, but at too swift a rate for the conscience of them
I saw this
I saw this Sir John de Walton, and I acknowledge that a thought, which had already intruded itself on my imagination, became, after this interview, by frequent recurrence, more familiar, and more welcome to me
I saw this afternoon a number of newly-captured slave women and girls fetching water under the guard of a scoundrel with a loaded musket
I saw this afternoon that you were not well
I saw this almost immediately, for the bright colour faded out of her face while I was speaking to her
I saw this bed, says the Saint, and I still tremble in all my limbs at the mere thought of it
I saw this by the little light that came through the window from the clouded night sky

I saw this sunrise daily for a week, and its glories seemed greater every day
I saw this sylvan chivalry, half huntsmen, half freebooters, trooping across the distant glades, or feasting and revelling beneath the trees; I was going on to embody in this way all the ballad scenes that had delighted me when a boy, when the distant sound of a wood-cutter's axe roused me from my day-dream

I saw those cousins of yours looking askance at our old travelling-dresses yesterday

I saw three or four there to-day, at one time
I saw three troopers leave the ranks and advance towards me; when one of them who rode considerably ahead of the other two arrived within hailing distance, he hailed me as a friend

I saw through him
I saw through his game

I saw thy conduct with emotion, Prayed my God to own and bless What thou didst through love's devotion, To increase my happiness
I saw thy form in youthful prime, Nor thought that pale decay Would steal before the steps of Time, And waste its bloom away, Mary!
I saw thy great suffering; but in a year, in a month, this will seem a thing of no import; only, when thou art calm and canst think, hold a Meeting in thy own heart, and ask thy quiet judgment, thy conscience, thy memory, if prayer be needed; and do it for thyself, Hugh
I saw thy heart begin to melt, Like ice before the sun; Till both a glow congenial felt, And mingled into one! TO

I saw to my infinite relief that he was at last emerging from this interminable feast of names

I saw too, at this last visit, a Virgin and Child, which appeared to me to have an expression more adequate to the subject than most of the innumerable virgins and children, in which we see only repetitions of simple maternity; indeed, any mother, with her first child, would serve an artist for one of them

I saw your struggles, dear, your patient grief, your silent sacrifice, and honored you more truly than I can tell

I saw, and shot, thirteen varieties of antelopes while in Africa
I saw, and started from my cottage-hearth; And to the clouds and waves in tameless gladness Shrieked, till they caught immeasurable mirth--  And laughed in light and music: soon, sweet madness Was poured upon my heart, a soft and thrilling sadness
I saw, and started, from its vernal bower, The rising game, and chased from flower to flower; It fled, I follow'd; now in hope, now pain; It stopp'd, I stopp'd; it moved, I moved again

I saw, as I had never dreamed I could see when I heard David speak of it, how God's Presence is infinite and real; how it guides the blazing stars, and how our life is but an instant and is nothing beside it; and how it makes no difference that we pass into nothingness--His glory is still the same

I saw, as I wrote, with painful clearness its sure results,--the Slave Power arrogant and defiant, strengthened and encouraged to carry out its scheme for the extension of its baleful system, or the dissolution of the Union, the guaranties of personal liberty in the free States broken down, and the whole country made the hunting-ground of slave-catchers

I saw, or seemed to see, the arched apartments, the procession of venerable matrons, the consecrated vestments: the very temple began to rise upon my sight, when a Dutch porpoise approaching to make me a low bow; his complaisance was full as notorious as Satan's, when, according to Catholic legends, he took leave of Calvin

I saw, then, how idle were my griefs; that I had acquired <i>the thought</i> of each object which had been taken from me; that more extended personal relations would only have given me pleasures which then seemed not worth my care, and which would surely have dimmed my sense of the spiritual meaning of all which had passed
I saw, then, that HE COULD NOT SMILE

I saw, too, that I had put my hand to a task that was too great for me, yet which I might not give over, once I had taken it up
I saw, too, that
I saw, too, that eccentricity was, as my uncle had told me, the fashion; and if the folk upon the Continent look upon us even to this day as being a nation of lunatics, it is no doubt a tradition handed down from the time when the only travellers whom they were likely to see were drawn from the class which I was now meeting
I saw, too, that from a certain point of view the stand of the agnostic is a right one

I saw, too, the cloud which hung over you, and felt that my hand could lift it
I saw, too, with alarm, that to all means for the accomplishment of his project he would be urged by despair; for his debts are great, and his character nothing but new wealth can support
